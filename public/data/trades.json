      "analysis": "AppLovin is currently trading below its calculated 0.5 and 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels from its 52-week range, indicating no reaction within the Golden Zone for a potential bounce. The price is also significantly below both its 20-day and 150-day (proxy 200-day) moving averages, confirming a downtrend. Furthermore, current trading volume is below its average, failing to show rising relative volume on any bounce. Therefore, no valid swing trade setup is identified.",

      "analysis": "Iris Energy Limited is trading above its calculated Golden Zone, meaning it is not currently interacting with the 0.5 or 0.618 Fibonacci retracement levels for a swing trade entry. While the stock is above its 200-day moving average, suggesting a longer-term uptrend, its recent price action and short-term trend are negative following a recent earnings miss. Current volume is also below average, indicating a lack of conviction for a bounce. Thus, no actionable swing trade setup is present.",

      "analysis": "NVIDIA is currently trading well above its significant Fibonacci retracement levels (0.5 and 0.618) from its 52-week range, indicating no price reaction within the Golden Zone. Although NVIDIA maintains a strong long-term uptrend, it is experiencing a recent pullback. There is no clear test of the 20-day moving average with a concurrent increase in relative volume to suggest a bullish swing trade entry. Current volume is below average. Consequently, this ticker does not present a valid swing trade opportunity based on the specified criteria.",
