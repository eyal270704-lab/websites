      "analysis": "Apple is exhibiting strong bullish momentum, trading robustly above its 150-day and 20-day moving averages. While not directly at a key Fibonacci retracement Golden Zone from major historical swings, a potential retest of the recent support near the 20-day MA could serve as an entry point. Positive news regarding iPhone demand and AI integration suggests continued underlying strength.",

      "analysis": "Microsoft has recently undergone a significant post-earnings price decline, placing it below both its 150-day and 20-day moving averages, indicating a short-term bearish trend. However, the price is currently re-approaching a previous 0.5 Fibonacci retracement level where it found support and rebounded. This area could signal a potential accumulation zone if buying interest re-emerges.",
