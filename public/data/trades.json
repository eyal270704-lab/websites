      "analysis": "AppLovin Corporation exhibits negative short and long-term trends, with a recent bearish crossover of the 20-day moving average. The stock is trading near the lows of its monthly range. Although current volume is slightly above average, it is not on a bounce from a defined support level, and there is no clear Golden Zone Fibonacci retracement. Specific entry and stop loss levels could not be determined due to the lack of a valid technical setup based on the 'Micha Stocks' method.",

      "analysis": "Red Cat Holdings is in an uptrend, trading above its 50-day ($11.86) and 200-day ($10.49) moving averages, with significant gains following recent positive news like the Pentagon Drone contract. However, recent trading volume on Feb 25, 2026 shows a decline of 35% from the average session volume, indicating a lack of rising relative volume on a bounce. Specific Fibonacci retracement levels for an entry are not identifiable from available data, thus concrete entry and stop loss levels cannot be determined for a swing trade.",

However, available data does not provide the specific technical indicators required for a swing trade setup, such as clear Fibonacci retracement levels, price action around the 150-day or 20-day moving averages, or rising relative volume on a bounce. Therefore, precise entry and stop loss levels cannot be determined.",

Despite recent price movement, the available technical analysis data is insufficient to identify clear Fibonacci retracement levels, reliable moving average positions for a swing trade setup, or consistent rising relative volume on a bounce. Conflicting technical signals also exist. Consequently, specific entry and stop loss levels cannot be established.",
