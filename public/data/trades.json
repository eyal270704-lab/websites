The price is currently trading below its 20-day moving average, indicating a short-term bearish trend or deep pullback from its 52-week highs.

The price is currently testing a significant support zone around $40-$41, suggesting a potential area for accumulation.

This indicates robust bullish momentum for a trend continuation play. While not a typical Fibonacci retracement setup, the consistent higher closes suggest continued strength, despite current volume being slightly below average.",
