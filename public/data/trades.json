While the price is near the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level from its 52-week range, there is no evidence of rising relative volume on a bounce. Upcoming earnings are not within the next 5 days, but the overall technical picture does not align with a valid swing trade setup based on the 'Micha Stocks' method.",

The price is currently near its 20-day EMA ($12.59), indicating a potential area of support. However, reported volume is below its 20-day average. A company event scheduled for February 27, 2026, presents a near-term catalyst, increasing the inherent risk of the trade.",

There is no clear Golden Zone retracement setup or indication of rising relative volume on a bounce. Most significantly, NVIDIA has confirmed earnings for February 25, 2026, which is within the next 5 days. This presents a substantial high-risk catalyst, making any swing trade highly speculative.",

The stock is significantly below its 20-day SMA ($27.42) and 200-day SMA ($36.97), reflecting a strong bearish trend. There is no indication of a Golden Zone reaction or rising relative volume on a bounce. Recent earnings were just reported, and future earnings are outside the 5-day window. The overall technicals do not support a valid swing trade setup, and the trend remains strongly bearish.",
