      "analysis": "Apple has experienced a healthy pullback to the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level after a strong uptrend. Volume has been subdued during this pullback, indicating a lack of strong selling pressure, and the stock remains firmly above its 150-day moving average. This setup suggests a potential bounce from a key support zone.",

      "analysis": "Microsoft has shown strong relative strength in the broader market, even as some tech stocks faced pressure. The recent shallow pullback to the 0.5 Fibonacci retracement presents a momentum setup, with the stock maintaining its position well above the 150-day moving average. Entry around this level targets a continuation of the prevailing uptrend.",

A breakout above $183, with accompanying volume confirmation, would signal a continuation of the rally.

While the general trend remains bullish above the 150-day moving average, commodity volatility introduces higher risk, making this a more speculative entry. Close monitoring of price action and volume is crucial.",
