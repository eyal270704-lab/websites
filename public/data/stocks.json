          "summary": "U.S. stock markets experienced a significant downturn today, with all major indices diving more than 1.5% in a high-velocity sell-off. The aggressive downturn followed a pivotal Supreme Court ruling that struck down President Donald Trump's sweeping emergency tariff policies, triggering an immediate and fiery retaliation from the White House with new 15% across-the-board tariffs. Overall market sentiment was highly cautious, with trading volume surging amid panic selling and reflecting broad-based declines across sectors.",
