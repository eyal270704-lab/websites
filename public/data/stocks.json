          "summary": "U.S. equities experienced a mixed close on Friday, February 13, ahead of the Presidents' Day holiday, with major indices reacting to a softening inflation report and continued sector rotations. While encouraging inflation and jobs data offered some calm, concerns about AI competition led to weakness in certain tech segments. Overall market sentiment points to a continued shift away from large-cap tech toward value, foreign equities, and defensive sectors. Not financial advice.",
