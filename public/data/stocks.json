          "summary": "U.S. equities experienced a significant rebound on Friday, February 7, 2026, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJIA) closing above the historic 50,000 mark for the first time ever. The rally was broad-based, fueled by a resurgence in investor risk appetite and renewed optimism surrounding the U.S. economy, particularly as concerns about AI's business impact softened. While major indices posted strong daily gains, the S&P 500 ($GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite ($IXIC) ended the week lower, indicating underlying volatility and a rotation of capital. Overall market sentiment remains cautious despite Friday's strong performance. Not financial advice.",
