The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved a historic milestone, closing above 50,000 for the first time. The week had been marked by investor anxiety over the impact of new AI tools on software companies and a rotation away from growth stocks. While Friday saw widespread gains, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the S&P 500 still finished the week slightly lower.",
