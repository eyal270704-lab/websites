          "summary": "U.S. stock futures edged higher today, February 12, with the S&P 500 showing gains, following a mixed close on Wednesday. A stronger-than-expected January jobs report has bolstered economic resilience but tempered expectations for aggressive Federal Reserve rate cuts, shifting the likely timing of the first cut to July from June. Sector performance is seeing rotation, with Energy and Materials leading, while Financials and Communication Services lag. The technology sector displayed divergence, as chipmakers rallied while software stocks saw declines amid lingering AI concerns.",
