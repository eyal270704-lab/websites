          "summary": "U.S. stock futures opened lower on Tuesday, following a mixed close for major indices on Friday that capped off a losing week. Investor sentiment remains cautious, largely influenced by ongoing concerns surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) disruption across various sectors and heightened geopolitical risks from U.S.-Iran talks. Soft inflation data released recently failed to significantly boost market participants. Trading volumes are thinner due to Lunar New Year holidays in several Asian markets.",
