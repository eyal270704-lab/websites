          "summary": "U.S. stock markets concluded the trading week on Friday, February 14, 2026, with major indices generally in the red for the week, although some pared losses by Friday's close. The sentiment was influenced by a cooler-than-expected January inflation report, which saw consumer prices growing at an annual rate of 2.4%, down from 2.7% in December. This data led to a drop in mortgage rates. However, broader market concerns, particularly around the high costs and potential disruptive impact of artificial intelligence on certain tech sectors, continued to weigh on investor confidence. While the S&P 500 and Dow were largely unchanged or slightly up on Friday, the Nasdaq Composite saw a modest gain. The Federal Reserve maintains a neutral rate stance, with market probabilities suggesting rates will remain unchanged in the near term.",
