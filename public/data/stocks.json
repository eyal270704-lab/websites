          "summary": "U.S. equities saw a mixed close on Wednesday, February 11, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average achieving a new record high. However, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite experienced declines, largely influenced by stagnant December retail sales data which raised concerns about consumer spending momentum. This softer economic data is prompting traders to increase expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year, with a 36% chance now priced in for an April cut. Conversely, some Fed officials expressed hawkish views, suggesting rates could remain elevated. All eyes are now on upcoming inflation and unemployment reports for further guidance.",
