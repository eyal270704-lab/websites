          "summary": "US stock futures are trading higher this Wednesday morning as investors await the delayed January jobs report. While weak labor market data is anticipated, rising expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut in the first half of 2026 are bolstering market sentiment. Globally, Asian markets showed optimism, with Indian equities also expecting a positive but cautious trading day. Concerns around the impact of AI on financial firms and softer consumer data from Tuesday are tempering broader enthusiasm, even as the Dow closed at another record high yesterday.",
