          "summary": "Wall Street experienced a mixed close, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting a modest gain while the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 declined. Investor sentiment was shaped by ongoing assessments of U.S.-Iran talks, a fresh batch of fourth-quarter earnings, and persistent fears surrounding a potential AI bubble and its disruptive economic impact. US stock futures were trading lower on Friday, indicating a cautious start to the day. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased by 3.9% to 18.63.",
