          "summary": "Wall Street extended gains for a second consecutive session, fueled by Nvidia's upbeat revenue forecast which revived confidence in the AI trade. The Nasdaq 100 led the rebound, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones erasing earlier tariff-driven losses. While momentum appears positive in the near term, thinning futures volume and major psychological resistance levels suggest that a straightforward break to new highs may not be imminent. Market sentiment remains cautious, especially following Salesforce's softer guidance and ongoing geopolitical developments concerning tariffs. U.S. stock futures showed a slight decline in early trading, indicating a potentially softer open.",
