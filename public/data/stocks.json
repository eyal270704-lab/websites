While the Dow Jones Industrial Average continued its ascent, the Nasdaq Composite saw a slight decline. Investor sentiment remains constructive despite lingering geopolitical tensions and anticipation of key economic data releases later this week, including the consumer price index and jobs report. Tech stocks are once again in focus, with a rebound seen in some names after last week's AI-driven sell-off.",
