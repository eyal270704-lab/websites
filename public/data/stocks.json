          "summary": "US equity markets experienced a notable decline at the close of the trading week on Friday, February 27, 2026, and continued to show weakness in early trading on February 28, driven by hotter-than-expected inflation data and persistent concerns surrounding the artificial intelligence (AI) sector. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are set to record their steepest monthly losses since March 2025, while the Dow Jones also closed lower. Investors are actively de-risking from crowded AI and growth trades amidst valuation concerns and a murky outlook for Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.",
