          "summary": "U.S. equity markets are closed today for the Presidents' Day holiday, though futures edged higher in subdued trading. Overall market sentiment remains mixed, influenced by cooling inflation data which offers hope for Federal Reserve rate cuts, yet tempered by persistent concerns over AI disruption across various sectors. Indian markets, however, saw a strong rebound, with key indices closing nearly 1% higher, driven by financials and energy stocks. Global trading volumes are generally thin due to multiple Asian markets being closed for Lunar New Year.",
