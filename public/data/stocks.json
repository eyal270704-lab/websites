          "summary": "U.S. stocks experienced a broad sell-off on Friday, February 27, 2026, as Wall Street continued to penalize companies perceived as potential losers in the artificial intelligence revolution. A surprisingly discouraging update on inflation further dampened market sentiment, while rising oil prices, fueled by tensions between the United States and Iran, also contributed to the downturn. All major indices closed lower, with the S&P 500 ending its second losing month in the last ten.",
