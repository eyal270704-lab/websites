          "summary": "U.S. equity markets are reflecting a cautiously optimistic sentiment as of February 8, 2026, building on a significant rally that concluded the previous trading week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notably surged above 50,000 for the first time on Friday, February 6, demonstrating a robust rebound across major indices. Market leadership is observed to be broadening, shifting away from a narrow tech focus towards economically sensitive sectors and value stocks, signaling a more diversified market rally. However, a selective approach to AI-driven tech investments is emerging amongst investors. Not financial advice.",
