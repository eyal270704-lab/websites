          "summary": "Global markets experienced significant volatility on Friday, February 13, 2026, with major US indices closing sharply lower on Thursday as investor sentiment shifted amid growing concerns about the disruptive potential of artificial intelligence across various industries. Indian benchmarks also tumbled, particularly in IT and metal sectors. A noticeable rotation out of tech-heavy investments into more 'tangible' sectors like industrials, energy, and basic materials is underway. Despite the cautious sentiment, some areas of the forex market showed cautious optimism due to mixed economic data and geopolitical developments. US stock futures indicated a softer opening on Friday morning.",
