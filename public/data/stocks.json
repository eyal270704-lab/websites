          "summary": "Today, February 17, 2026, global markets experienced a mixed trading session. While US equity futures showed signs of recovery after initial declines, extending last week's selloff driven by artificial intelligence (AI) disruption concerns, Asian markets saw subdued volumes due to Lunar New Year holidays. Indian benchmarks erased early losses, with IT stocks leading gains. The overarching sentiment remains cautious, with investors keenly watching economic data and geopolitical developments. Not financial advice.",
