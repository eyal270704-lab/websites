          "summary": "U.S. equity markets closed a volatile week with major indices seeing minor movements on Friday, February 14, 2026. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted slight gains, while the Nasdaq Composite experienced a modest decline. The day's trading was influenced by an encouraging update on inflation, which showed consumer price index (CPI) falling to 2.4% in January, easing some concerns on Wall Street. The Federal Reserve maintained its neutral rate stance, while the ongoing discussion around the next Fed Chair also garnered attention. As markets are closed for the weekend, this digest reflects the closing data from Friday's trading session.",
