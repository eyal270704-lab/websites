          "summary": "U.S. stock markets are closed today in observance of Presidents' Day. Major indices ended last week on a weaker footing, pressured by renewed concerns over artificial intelligence (AI) related capital expenditure and potential structural disruption to industries. Market sentiment globally remains cautious, with some Asian and European markets showing mixed activity. Investors are digesting recent economic data, including moderated US inflation and resilient labor market figures, which have shifted Federal Reserve rate cut expectations.",

Indian markets saw defensive and consumption-linked indices, including FMCG, pharma, healthcare, and realty, outperform.

Last week, non-farm payrolls increased by 130,000, and the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 4.3%. Headline consumer inflation moderated to 2.4% year-on-year, with core inflation also retreating to 2.4%. This unexpected resilience in the labor market has shifted Federal Reserve rate cut expectations from June to July 2026, with some pricing in further reductions by March 2027. The minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest FOMC meeting are expected to be released on Wednesday, providing further insights into monetary policy. Additionally, advance fourth-quarter GDP figures and PCE inflation data for December are due on Friday.",
