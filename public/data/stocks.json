          "summary": "U.S. equity markets closed Friday, February 20, 2026, with gains across major indices, staging a significant reversal from earlier losses. This turnaround was largely propelled by a Supreme Court ruling that struck down sweeping tariffs imposed under emergency powers, sparking a broad relief rally. Despite initial concerns over weaker-than-expected Q4 GDP growth and mixed economic data, and lingering geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran, investor sentiment shifted positively, with technology and energy sectors leading the charge.",
