                        <strong>U.S. Markets Slip:</strong> U.S. stock indexes experienced a decline, primarily driven by a drop in major technology shares, including Oracle, Nvidia, and Tesla, as investors engaged in profit-taking after a robust year. This comes as the S&P 500 is still on pace for its eighth monthly gain in a row and its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains.

                        <strong>Recent Market Performance:</strong> While the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange saw significant declines of up to 2% on December 25th, driven by a correction in insurance stocks and concerns over potential new taxes on bank profits, it had previously shown strong gains. On December 28th, the TA-35 index gained 0.43%, and the TA-90 index rose by 1.06%.

                        <strong>Record-Breaking Year for TASE:</strong> The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has reached multiple record highs in 2025, outperforming global markets despite ongoing conflicts.

                        <strong>Foreign Investment Inflows:</strong> Foreign investors made substantial purchases of local shares, amounting to approximately NIS 4.3 billion (about $2.3 billion) in 2025, primarily targeting the financial and defense sectors.

                        <strong>High-Tech Sector Challenges:</strong> Employees at major tech firms in Israel, including Microsoft, Intel, Nvidia, Amazon, Meta, and Apple, are increasingly seeking to relocate abroad due to ongoing uncertainty from the prolonged conflict. This trend is a concern for Israel's local innovation and technological leadership.

                        <strong>Economic Resilience Amidst Strain:</strong> Israel's economy is transitioning to a more stable growth phase, with inflation easing to 2.4% in November. However, the economy faces strain from capital flight, particularly in high-tech, and increased reliance on foreign loans, with debt projected to reach 70% of GDP in 2025. The shekel has appreciated against the U.S. dollar, and the TASE's record highs are partly buoyed by wartime spending.
