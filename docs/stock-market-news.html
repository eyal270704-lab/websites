                    <strong class="text-gray-900">US Stocks Rally Amid Easing Trade Tensions:</strong> Major US indices, including the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq, saw a rally after President Donald Trump indicated a de-escalation of tariff threats against Europe and mentioned a "framework" deal concerning Greenland at the World Economic Forum in Davos. This news significantly eased concerns about a renewed trade war.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Tech Stocks Surge on AI Infrastructure Outlook:</strong> Chip-related stocks experienced a notable jump, with Nvidia-supplier Disco Corp. surging 17% and Samsung Electronics Co. advancing 3.6%. This rise followed Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks about the need for multi-trillion-dollar investments in global AI infrastructure. South Korea's benchmark index, often a bellwether for technology stocks, climbed to a new record.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Gold Prices Dip, Oil Prices Rise:</strong> Spot gold prices declined by 0.7% after hitting a record high on Wednesday, as the reduction in geopolitical tensions curbed safe-haven demand. Conversely, oil prices edged up, with WTI crude rising 0.4% to US$60.61 a barrel and Brent crude up 0.5% to US$65.22 a barrel, attributed to a force majeure at the Tengiz oilfield.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Australian and Indian Markets React:</strong> The Australian share market (ASX 200) is poised for a rebound following a strong performance on Wall Street. However, a surge in Australian employment figures has increased the likelihood of an earlier interest rate hike, which could impact stocks negatively. Indian equities experienced a volatile trading session, ending in the red for the third consecutive day, but later tracked global gains. Notable Indian companies like Eternal Ltd, L&T, Corona Remedies, and Apollo Hospitals were in the news due to strong quarterly results, strategic acquisitions, and regulatory approvals.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Federal Reserve Independence Under Threat:</strong> The Justice Department has reportedly threatened the Federal Reserve with a criminal indictment over Fed Chair Jerome Powell's testimony regarding building renovations. This marks a significant escalation in attempts by the Trump administration to exert greater control over the Federal Reserve, an action that could lead to falling stock prices and spiking bond yields.
