                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
                    <li>U.S. stock futures climbed early Monday, with investors anticipating a rebound in tech names during the holiday-shortened trading week. Futures on the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up.</li>
                    <li>Asian markets largely traded higher on December 22, following China's central bank keeping its loan prime rates unchanged. Japan's Nikkei increased by 1.81%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index surged by 0.43%, and China's Shanghai Composite gained 0.69%.</li>
                    <li>European indexes opened mixed on Monday, after a solid rally last week, with some weighing lower due to energy companies. Germany's DAX edged 0.1% higher, while France's CAC 40 slipped 0.2%, and Britain's FTSE 100 shed 0.3%.</li>
                    <li>AI-related stocks saw a rebound, with Nvidia (NVDA) climbing on reports of potential White House approval for H200 AI chip sales to select Chinese firms. Oracle (ORCL) shares surged after securing a deal to co-lead TikTok's U.S. operations via a new joint venture. Micron's shares surged over 18% due to robust memory chip demand.</li>
                    <li>Gold prices reached a record high on Monday, surpassing $4,400 an ounce, driven by expectations of further U.S. interest-rate cuts next year and increased safe-haven demand.</li>
                    <li>The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was up, floating near 4.16%, and WTI crude oil futures were trending higher, hovering near $57.04 per barrel.</li>
                    <li>In India, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty ended higher, extending Friday's gains, with buying interest in IT and metal stocks. The Sensex gained 0.75%, and the Nifty50 rose 0.79%. Notable Indian gainers included Trent, Infosys, Bharti Airtel, Shriram Finance, and Wipro.</li>
                    <li>Market trends nearing year-end include the anticipation of a "Santa Claus rally," with historical data suggesting an average gain of 1.3% for the S&P 500 during this period. Cooling inflation and Fed rate-cut expectations are seen as tailwinds for defensive and value-oriented equities.</li>
                    <li>Upcoming economic data this week includes ADP employment change numbers, durable goods orders, and initial jobless claims in the U.S..</li>

                <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
                    <li>Israeli startups raised $15.6 billion in 2025, with exits totaling $74 billion, signaling a return to a measure of normality despite the year's geopolitical events.</li>
                    <li>The AI revolution has significantly reshaped investment dynamics in Israel, leading to a sharp fall in the number of funding rounds but a surge in deal sizes. Half of all capital raised went into deals larger than $100 million.</li>
                    <li>Cybersecurity and generative AI dominated funding activity throughout 2025, accounting for approximately 70% of the total capital raised. Fintech and defense-technology companies also stood out.</li>
                    <li>Nine funding rounds exceeded $200 million during the year, with cybersecurity company Cyera leading by raising a combined $940 million across two rounds.</li>
                    <li>Israel also saw a return to large IPOs in 2025, including Navan, eToro, and Via going public, with additional capital flowing from convertible bond offerings by companies like Wix and Check Point.</li>
                    <li>The renewed inflow of capital into the Israeli high-tech sector is contributing to the strengthening of the shekel against the dollar.</li>
