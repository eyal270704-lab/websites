          <li>Global markets, including major exchanges in the US and Europe, are experiencing a New Year's holiday lull on January 4, 2026, resulting in low trading activity and no significant macroeconomic publications or corporate reports.</li>
          <li>The period from December 29, 2025, through January 4, 2026, is characterized as a transitional trading week with year-end position adjustments and thin liquidity.</li>
          <li>Investors are currently assessing 2025 results and preparing for the first full trading week of 2026, when new statistical indicators and reports are expected to emerge.</li>
          <li>The S&P 500 saw modest growth in late December amidst expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy in 2026, following interest rate cuts in the second half of 2025.</li>
          <li>Key Asian exchanges are closed today. China's December PMI indices show moderate growth in the services sector, while Japan's Nikkei 225 remains at multi-year highs due to a weak yen and the Bank of Japan's ultra-loose policy.</li>
          <li>The Morningstar DBRS outlook for private borrower credit quality in 2026 is negative, with expectations of deteriorating credit profiles for both high- and low-quality borrowers, and restrictive global trade policy posing a key threat.</li>
          <li>Analysts warn that 2026 could be "pretty ugly for AI stocks" if OpenAI faces challenges, predicting that Google's Gemini will gain market share and its Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) technology could take market share from Nvidia.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-4 text-black text-lg">
          <li>Effective January 5, 2026, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) will shift its trading schedule from Sunday-Thursday to Monday-Friday to align with global market practices, aiming to attract foreign investors and enhance market accessibility. Friday will operate as a shortened trading day.</li>
          <li>Israel's economy enters 2026 at a "highly sensitive point," facing challenges from sharply rising defense expenditures and elevated debt levels following two years of war, which could impact civilian services and public investment without sustained rapid economic growth.</li>
          <li>As of January 2026, Israeli citizens are experiencing increased costs for electricity, water, taxes, and basic services, a direct consequence of the Gaza war's economic repercussions and government measures to address the budget deficit.</li>
          <li>Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich announced plans to address the power of large banks and monopolies in the 2026 state budget, aiming to lower the cost of living and accusing these entities of profiting during the recent conflict.</li>
          <li>In 2025, Israel's main stock indexes, including the TA-125, TA-35, and TA-90, recorded significant gains, with the TA-125 rising approximately 50%, outperforming many global markets due to investor confidence, strong corporate results, and an easing of geopolitical tensions.</li>
          <li>The Israeli shekel strengthened by about 12% against the US dollar in 2025, and government bond yields fell by approximately 80 basis points, indicating a perceived reduction in risk.</li>
