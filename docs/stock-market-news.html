      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Capital Market Highlights</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) is making a historic shift, transitioning from its long-standing Sunday-to-Thursday trading week to a Monday-to-Friday schedule, effective January 5, 2026.</li>
        <li>This change, approved by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, aims to align Israel's capital market with international standards, attract foreign investors, and enhance the chances of Israeli stocks being included in major global indices.</li>
        <li>Friday trading sessions on the TASE will be shortened, concluding at 2:00 p.m. local time.</li>
        <li>Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) announced a $242 million dividend distribution to the state from its 2024 profits, following strong business results and ongoing discussions about the company's potential full privatization.</li>
        <li>Economically, January 1, 2026, brings various tax-related changes in Israel. A slight increase in the pension tax exemption takes effect.</li>
        <li>However, other proposed reforms, such as income tax relief and a new surtax on real estate investors, are currently stalled, and frozen income tax brackets will effectively lead to a 3% increase in tax burden.</li>
