                    <strong class="text-gray-900">U.S. Equities Decline:</strong> Major U.S. indices experienced a significant sell-off as investors adopted a risk-off stance, particularly unwinding positions in technology and AI-linked stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by nearly 600 points, the S&P 500 dropped 1.23%, and the Nasdaq Composite led losses with a 1.59% decline.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Tech Sector Under Pressure:</strong> Alphabet (GOOGL) shares dipped 0.5% following its earnings report, as its outlook for sharply higher AI spending (up to $185 billion in 2026 capital expenditures) raised concerns about return on investment. Other software and AI beneficiaries like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), Salesforce (CRM), and Palantir Technologies (PLTR) also saw weakness.

The tech sector, however, faced outflows of $2.03 billion.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">European Market Performance:</strong> The STOXX 600 reached a record high. The European Central Bank maintained its deposit rate at 2%, with headline inflation expectations for 2026 holding at 1.8% and core HICP inflation at 2.0%.

                    <strong class="text-gray-900">Commodity Movements:</strong> Oil, after extending a short-term bearish trend and hitting a target of $62.60, is now showing signs of rising again. Gold is climbing within a short-term uptrend.
