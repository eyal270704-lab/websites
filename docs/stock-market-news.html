            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
                <li class="text-lg">US stock futures traded mixed early Thursday as investors increased bets on a 25-basis point interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting, following an unexpected drop in private payrolls for November and contracting services sector employment.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">All three major US indexes closed higher on Wednesday, with the Dow rising 0.86%, the S&P 500 gaining 0.30%, and the Nasdaq edging up 0.17%, boosted by rate-cut hopes. The Russell 2000, representing small-cap companies, jumped approximately 2%.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">The dollar depreciated against most major peers, hitting a five-week low, as expectations for a Fed rate cut intensified (around 90% chance for a December cut).</li>
                <li class="text-lg">US 10-year Treasury yields were up, floating near 4.08%.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">Brent crude oil futures were trending higher, hovering near $62.89 per barrel, amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and uncertainties in global supply and demand.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">Gold Spot U.S. dollar price decreased to nearly $4,190 per ounce on Thursday, while precious metals generally extended gains amid risk-hedging sentiment. Bitcoin also hovered near US$93,500.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">In Europe, markets opened mostly higher, with the DAX 40 in Frankfurt up 0.9% and France's CAC 40 up 0.3%, as traders anticipated regional data releases and responded to US rate cut expectations. The Euro Area's main stock market index, the EU50, rose 0.14% to 5708 points.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">Asian markets showed mixed performance. Japan's Nikkei 225 climbed 2.3% and neared its all-time high, driven by strong demand in a government bond auction and expectations of a US Fed rate cut, with SoftBank Group Corp.'s shares jumping 9.2% due to a strategic shift to AI investments. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index also gained 0.5%, led by tech and consumer stocks. However, South Korea's Kospi fell 0.2%, and the Shanghai Composite edged down 0.1%.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">In India, benchmark indices Sensex and Nifty rebounded on Thursday, snapping a four-day losing streak, aided by buying in IT stocks. The Nifty IT index was the top gainer, up 1.4%. The Indian Rupee hit a record low of 90.56 against the US dollar.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">Companies like ChargePoint (CHPT), DocuSign (DOCU), Kroger Company (KR), and Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) are expected to release earnings today. Marvell Technology climbed 9% in pre-market trading after strong quarterly results, especially in data center revenue. Microchip Technology leaped 12.2% after expecting sales and profit at the high end of forecasts.</li>
                <li class="text-lg">AI boom continues to drive investment and stock market gains, particularly in tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, cushioning against a potential U.S. economic slowdown. Concerns about an "AI bubble" persist, but Fitch Ratings believes stretched valuations don't necessarily dictate future market directions.</li>
