            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-black">
                <li>U.S. markets experienced a volatile start to 2026, following a strong performance in 2025 where the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite recorded significant gains.</li>
                <li>Concerns for the new year include potential division at the Federal Reserve, elevated stock valuations (with the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings Ratio at its second priciest multiple in a continuous bull market), and the potential economic impact of U.S. tariff policies.</li>
                <li>The "AI bubble" is not expected to burst, but analysts suggest a shift from "hype to harvest," with investors anticipating solid returns from AI investments in 2026.</li>
                <li>Private credit quality is projected to deteriorate in 2026, driven by increased borrower leverage, constrained margins, and evolving global trade policies.</li>
                <li>In individual stock news, SanDisk (SNDK) was the top performer in the S&P 500 for 2025, soaring 559% post-spin-off, largely due to strong demand for data storage fueled by artificial intelligence.</li>
                <li>European shares commenced 2026 at record highs, with the STOXX 600 nearing the 600-point mark and London's FTSE 100 surpassing 10,000 for the first time.</li>
                <li>Gold prices continued their upward trend, while crude oil prices saw a slight decline.</li>

        <div class="bg-white p-6 rounded-lg shadow-xl">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Market Highlights</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-black">
                <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) officially transitioned its trading week to Monday-Friday starting January 5, 2026, eliminating Sunday trading. This strategic shift aims to align with global market practices, enhance accessibility for foreign investors, and facilitate inclusion in international indices like MSCI Europe.</li>
                <li>In 2025, Israel's main stock indexes, including the TA-35, TA-125, and TA-90, achieved multiple record highs, significantly outperforming global markets despite ongoing regional conflicts. The TA-125 rose to 3733 points on January 1, 2026, marking a 52.05% increase year-over-year.</li>
                <li>Trading volumes on the TASE reached record levels in 2025, with an average daily turnover of NIS 3.4 billion, a 56% increase from 2024.</li>
                <li>Foreign investors demonstrated confidence in the Israeli market, acquiring NIS 4.3 billion worth of local shares in 2025, primarily in the financial and defense sectors.</li>
                <li>The Israeli economy faces significant financial pressures entering 2026, stemming from the Gaza war. The government has approved increases in electricity, water, taxes, and basic services to address a growing budget deficit.</li>
                <li>The repercussions of massive military spending, coupled with declining investment and tourism, are leading to rising living costs and reduced household purchasing power, prompting warnings of potential social unrest.</li>
                <li>Israel's rural real estate and urban renewal sectors are reportedly undergoing a maturation process, emphasizing thorough planning and risk management over purely entrepreneurial approaches.</li>
