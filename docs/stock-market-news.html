            <strong class="text-gray-900">U.S. Markets Rally on AI Momentum:</strong> U.S. stock markets closed higher on Friday, December 19, 2025, with all three major indexes (Dow, Nasdaq, S&P 500) posting gains, primarily driven by a resurgence in AI-related stocks. Futures for Monday, December 22, were also mostly higher, signaling a positive start to the holiday-shortened week.
