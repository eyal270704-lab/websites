          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">US Markets:</strong> Wall Street closed lower on Tuesday, January 13, primarily due to a dip in financial shares following concerns over President Trump's proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates. The S&P 500 slipped 0.19%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8%, and the Nasdaq Composite eased 0.1%. December's inflation data showed a 2.7% annual increase, aligning with economists' expectations and maintaining market anticipation for Federal Reserve rate cuts later in the year.

          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Asian Markets:</strong> Asian shares showed modest gains in early trading on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average rose 0.9%, fueled by a weaker yen. South Korean shares also extended their winning streak. Australian shares recorded a two-month closing high, with the S&P/ASX 200 up 0.14%, driven by strong performances in mining and energy sectors amid firmer commodity prices, including record-high copper prices.

          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Indian Markets:</strong> Indian benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty, experienced volatility but traded with modest gains on Wednesday. Sectoral trends indicated strength in metals and oil-linked spaces, while IT, auto, and realty sectors faced pressure. Geopolitical concerns and foreign institutional investor outflows continue to influence market sentiment.

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Economic Outlook:</strong> Global economic growth saw a slowdown in December 2025, but muted price pressures are fostering expectations for interest rate cuts in 2026. The US economy is projected to experience a downturn in Q4 2025 extending into H1 2026, though AI-driven productivity gains are expected to provide support.
