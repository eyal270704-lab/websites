      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>Global markets commenced 2026 with a positive, "risk-on tone," with many indices registering gains.</li>
        <li>The UK's FTSE 100 index achieved a historic milestone, breaking the 10,000-point mark for the first time on Friday, reaching an intraday record of 10,046 points. This surge was a continuation of a robust 2025, where the index climbed 21.5%, with notable contributions from Rolls-Royce, Burberry, and Fresnillo.</li>
        <li>The pan-European Stoxx 600 index also reached a record high, propelled by strong performances in the mining and energy sectors.</li>
        <li>Asian markets that were open, including South Korea's KOSPI and Hong Kong's Hang Seng, experienced significant gains. The KOSPI advanced 2.3% to a new record, while the Hang Seng surged 2.8%, largely driven by optimism surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) and strong tech stocks like Samsung Electronics and Baidu.</li>
        <li>U.S. stock futures for the Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average showed gains early Friday, recovering from a period of declines at the close of 2025. This follows a strong 2025 where the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow achieved double-digit returns, largely fueled by AI excitement.</li>
        <li>Precious metals like gold and silver rebounded, showing price increases and recouping some losses from the end of last week, building on a strong performance in 2025.</li>
        <li>WTI crude oil futures were trending higher, trading near $57.78 per barrel.</li>
        <li>Investors today are closely monitoring the release of global Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data for the manufacturing sector across several countries, providing initial insights into the new year's economic health.</li>

        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) will implement a new Monday-Friday trading schedule starting January 5, 2026. This strategic change aims to align the Israeli capital market with international standards, enhancing its appeal to foreign investors, improving market accessibility, and potentially leading to the inclusion of Israeli stocks in major global indices. Trading on Fridays will conclude at 2 p.m. in observance of the Jewish Sabbath.</li>
        <li>The Israeli military reported launching an interceptor missile towards a "suspicious aerial target" in northern Israel following siren activations.</li>
