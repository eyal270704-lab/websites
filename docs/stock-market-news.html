            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
                <li>US stock markets are experiencing increased volatility, with the VIX index rising nearly 30% since the start of January, currently near 19, signaling growing market fear. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 are slightly up year-to-date, but market behavior is becoming "wild".</li>
                <li>International stocks are attracting nearly all net inflows into developed market equities, causing the U.S. stock market to underperform. Europe and Japan have seen significant capital inflows.</li>
                <li>President Donald Trump's stance on tariffs, particularly concerning Greenland and potential 100% tariffs on Canada over its China trade deal, is contributing to market uncertainty and could lead to capital shifting from U.S. stocks to international markets.</li>
                <li>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to announce its first interest rate decision of 2026 this week. Investors are keenly watching comments from Chair Jerome Powell amid pressure to lower rates. The Fed had previously cut rates in 2025, bringing the federal funds rate to 3.50%–3.75%, and a pause is expected early this year.</li>
                <li>The "Magnificent 7" companies, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Tesla, and Apple, are slated to report earnings this week, with investors eager for insights into their AI strategies and performance.</li>
                <li>The IPO market is showing renewed momentum in 2026 after a strong rebound in 2025, with high-profile companies like SpaceX, Anthropic, Databricks, Cerebras, and OpenAI potentially going public.</li>
                <li>Gold prices are nearing $5,000 an ounce, driven by speculation of Federal Reserve rate cuts, though profit-taking remains a potential factor.</li>
                <li>The cryptocurrency market has shown consistent weakness this January, failing to maintain its recent recovery. Solana saw an 11.79% decline, while Bitcoin fell by 6.04%.</li>
