        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
          <li>U.S. major stock indexes, including the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq, saw a rebound on Wednesday, recovering some losses from the previous day. This followed President Trump's speech in Davos where he stated he would not use force to take Greenland, easing geopolitical tensions that had unsettled markets.</li>
          <li>Despite the rebound, concerns persist regarding President Trump's renewed threats of tariffs on several European countries, which analysts suggest could reignite a trade war.</li>
          <li>The S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio recorded above 39 in December, an extremely high valuation level last seen during the dot-com crash and historically associated with poor forward returns.</li>
          <li>Gold prices continued their upward trend, reaching a new record high of over $4,800 per ounce, signaling ongoing investor demand for safe-haven assets amidst market volatility.</li>
          <li>The energy sector emerged as the top-performing S&P 500 sector on Wednesday.</li>
          <li>Notable stock movements include Halliburton (HAL) and United Airlines (UAL) which climbed 3.6% and 2.5-3.5% respectively after reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profits. Nvidia (NVDA) also saw gains, up nearly 3%.</li>
          <li>Conversely, Netflix (NFLX) shares fell 3.5-4.8% after the company provided a disappointing outlook and announced a pause in stock buybacks. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) declined over 1% as its fourth-quarter profits missed analyst estimates. Kraft Heinz (KHC) dropped roughly 5% following news that Berkshire Hathaway might sell a significant portion of its stake.</li>
          <li>S&P 500 companies are generally beating earnings estimates, but investor reactions have been subdued, leading to the worst share-price responses on record as the outlook for 2026 remains uncertain and valuations are already high.</li>
          <li>TD Bank announced the expansion of its debt and equity capital market teams by recruiting senior bankers from rival institutions.</li>
          <li>In Japan, the Nikkei 225 slipped 0.4%, and yields on long-term government bonds reached record levels following a snap election call and expectations of increased government spending.</li>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
          <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's main index, the TA-125, decreased by 0.01% on January 21, 2026. However, it has shown robust performance over the longer term, climbing 6.36% in the past month and an impressive 53.80% over the last year. The TA 35 index lost 0.41% on Wednesday.</li>
          <li>The Israeli Shekel (NIS) appreciated to over NIS 3.16/$ today, driven by fears of a global trade war, though its recent strength around NIS 3.14/$ is attributed to strong local and structural factors, including Israel's improved economic position and market confidence. The Bank of Israel affirmed that the shekel's gains reflect strong fundamentals.</li>
          <li>Pulsenmore Ltd. (PLSM), an Israeli digital health company specializing in home prenatal ultrasound technology, commenced trading on both Nasdaq and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on January 21, 2026, following FDA authorization for its system.</li>
          <li>Among the top performers on the TA 35 index were Tower Semiconductor Ltd (TASE:TSEM), which rose 5.23%, OPC Energy Ltd (TASE:OPCE) with a 3.81% increase, and Ormat Technologies (TASE:ORA) gaining 2.52%.</li>
          <li>Conversely, some of the worst performers on the TA 35 included Menora Miv Hld (TASE:MMHD) down 3.54%, Camtek Ltd (TASE:CAMT) declining 3.24%, and Amot Investments Ltd (TASE:AMOT) falling 3.06%.</li>
          <li>Israeli AI-native financial planning platform Datarails successfully completed a $70 million Series C financing round, bringing its total capital raised to $175 million.</li>
          <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange is slated to shift its trading days to Monday through Friday by 2026, aligning with international standards to attract foreign investors and boost market liquidity.</li>
          <li>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the U.S. SEC chairman to discuss facilitating the listing of Israeli companies on American exchanges, aiming to reduce regulatory hurdles.</li>
          <li>A report indicated that Israeli agricultural exports are facing a "collapse" due to increasing boycotts related to the Gaza conflict, severely impacting orders from Europe and Asia.</li>
