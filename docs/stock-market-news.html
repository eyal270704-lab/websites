          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Market Closures:</strong> Most major global stock markets, including the US (NYSE, Nasdaq), UK, Germany, France, Australia, Canada, and India, are closed today, December 25, 2025, in observance of Christmas. Many markets also experienced early closures on December 24th or will be closed for Boxing Day on December 26th.

          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">US Market Performance (Pre-Holiday):</strong> In a holiday-shortened session on Wednesday, December 24th, the New York stock market closed higher, with the S&P 500 and Dow Jones indexes reaching record highs. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a 0.6% increase, Nasdaq rose by 0.22%, and the S&P 500 gained 0.32%. Expectations for further interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in the coming year remained consistent despite recent mixed economic data.

        <li>
          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Notable US Stocks (Pre-Holiday):</strong> Nike shares surged by 4.6% following reports of Apple CEO Tim Cook's share purchases. Conversely, Intel shares dipped by 0.5% after news that Nvidia ceased testing Intel's 18A chip manufacturing process.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Equity Capital Markets Recovery (2025 Overview):</strong> Global equity capital markets experienced a significant recovery in 2025, with issuance volumes climbing 25% year-on-year to $957.2 billion, marking the strongest performance since 2021. This recovery was primarily driven by activity in the Americas, despite political volatility, including a US government shutdown, which impacted IPO activity in the fourth quarter.

          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Market Status:</strong> The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) generally does not observe Christmas as a widespread market holiday, however, "Traded Foreign Funds" are not traded today, December 25th. Given widespread global closures, market activity is expected to be minimal. The last available data shows the TA-35 index rose 0.07% on December 23, 2025.

          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Tech Sector IPO Trends Shift:</strong> Israeli tech companies are increasingly favoring acquisitions over initial public offerings (IPOs) on Wall Street. Notable recent acquisitions include Armis for nearly $8 billion and Wiz to Google for $32 billion. This trend is influenced by longer IPO waits, higher revenue requirements for public listings (now $350-400 million annually), and the underwhelming post-IPO performance of many recent debuts, with the IPO Index up only 5% this year compared to the S&P 500's 18% and Nasdaq's 22% gains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Strong Performance in Specific Sectors:</strong> Despite broader IPO challenges, certain Israeli companies have achieved triple-digit gains on Wall Street in 2025. This includes firms in renewable energy, driven by increased demand for electricity for AI, and defense companies like Elbit Systems, which reported record order backlogs and substantial contracts.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Natural Gas Export Plans:</strong> Israel is reportedly exploring a plan to export natural gas to Cyprus, involving a pipeline connection from its offshore gas fields to Cypriot LNG facilities for global distribution. This initiative follows Israel's finalization of its largest natural gas export deal in history, estimated at approximately $34 billion.
