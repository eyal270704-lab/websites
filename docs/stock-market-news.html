      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>The FTSE 100 concluded the week at a new record high, advancing 0.8% to 10,124.60 points, primarily led by Glencore.</li>
        <li>Precious metals saw an uptick, with gold rising 1.4% to $4,511 per troy ounce and silver jumping 5% to $79.79 an ounce, attributed to a slowdown in the US labor market.</li>
        <li>Oil prices continued their decline following the removal of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, a development that could potentially increase global supply.</li>
        <li>US markets, as of January 9, 2026, witnessed the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite reaching record highs after a mixed US job market report. Small-cap stocks within the Russell 2000 notably outperformed larger technology and AI stocks.</li>
        <li>Small caps led the previous week's rally, indicating a broadening bull market beyond the traditional large-cap growth leaders. The Russell 2000 was up 6.6% over three months, surpassing the S&P 500's 3.7% gain in the same period.</li>
        <li>Materials, commodities, and blockchain sectors demonstrated strong performance, as investors shifted away from large caps, emerging markets, and utilities.</li>
        <li>Brazil's market recorded a significant gain of 44% over the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's 17.7% return.</li>
        <li>The 2026 Social Security Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) was finalized at 2.8%; however, retirees are facing a "major financial hit" due to COLAs not keeping pace with inflation and rising Medicare premiums.</li>
        <li>The U.S. government is set to restart aggressive student loan debt collection in January 2026, ending a five-year pause.</li>
        <li>Looking ahead to the upcoming week, significant events include major bank earnings from institutions like JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, along with the release of December inflation data (CPI), retail sales figures, and TSMC earnings reports.</li>
        <li>Historically, the S&P 500's current market behavior has been observed only twice in 153 years, suggesting a potential market decline in 2026 following valuation peaks.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) officially transitioned its trading days to Monday through Friday, effective January 2026, aligning with global market standards to attract foreign investors and boost liquidity.</li>
        <li>In its first Friday trading session on January 11, 2026, the main TASE indices experienced gains. The Tel Aviv 35 Index rose 0.71%, the Tel Aviv 125 Index increased by 0.73%, and the BlueTech Global Index climbed 1.27%. Equity turnover was notably higher than the average for Sundays under the previous schedule, indicating a positive impact of the change.</li>
        <li>On the foreign exchange market, the representative shekel-US dollar exchange rate was set 0.13% lower at NIS 3.1700/$, while the shekel-euro rate was set 0.35% lower at NIS 3.6920/€.</li>
        <li>Notable stock performances on January 11, 2026, included advancers such as Tower Semiconductor (+4.82%), Max Stock (+4.36%), AMRM (+3.81%), and Navitas (+3.67%). Bank Hapoalim rose by 2.30%, Bank Leumi by 1.024%, and Phoenix Finance by 1.59%. TopGum Industries Ltd. shares surged 26% in the last 30 days and 133% over the past year due to strong revenue growth.</li>

        <li>Israel's technology sector is experiencing an "extraordinary wave of exits," with deals totaling tens of billions of dollars. Significant acquisitions include Wiz by Google for $32 billion and Mentee Robotics by Mobileye for $900 million. This trend is bolstering the local economy and strengthening the capital market.</li>
        <li>The shekel recently reached a four-year peak against the US dollar and is projected to maintain its strength, provided global markets remain stable and capital inflow continues.</li>
        <li>The Governor of the Bank of Israel, Amir Yaron, cited the recovery of the local tech industry as a factor enabling the bank to reduce interest rates. Technology companies collectively raised NIS 5.8 billion in the fourth quarter of the previous year.</li>
        <li>Israel is preparing to price a new three-tranche SEC-registered dollar bond issue (January 2031s, January 2036s, and January 2056s) at levels close to its pre-war benchmarks, following a recent fragile ceasefire.</li>
