            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
                <li>U.S. stock futures showed marginal gains, as investors analyzed mixed jobs data from November, which saw 64,000 jobs added, surpassing estimates, despite a prior loss of 105,000 jobs in October that pushed the unemployment rate to 4.6%.</li>
                <li>On Tuesday's trading session, the S&P 500 and Dow experienced their third consecutive day of losses, while the Nasdaq Composite ended a three-day losing streak by edging higher amidst growing concerns about a potential AI market bubble.</li>
                <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve implemented its third interest rate cut of 2025 earlier this month, driven by concerns over a rising unemployment rate. The Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) indicates expectations for even lower interest rates in 2026 coupled with higher economic growth (GDP growth anticipated between 2.2% and 2.5%), a development generally seen as favorable for stocks.</li>
                <li>The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield saw an increase, hovering near 4.15%. WTI crude oil futures were trending upwards, close to $56.05 per barrel, and the Gold Spot U.S. dollar price rose to approximately $4,313 per ounce.</li>
                <li>Asia-Pacific markets largely traded higher on Wednesday, buoyed by regional data releases, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up 0.82%, China's Shanghai Composite gaining 1.19%, Shenzhen Component advancing 1.70%, and Japan's Nikkei increasing 0.26%.</li>
                <li>European indexes opened mostly higher on Wednesday, though Eurozone PMIs indicated a weakening in services and flat manufacturing, alongside rising costs.</li>
                <li>Global corporate defaults in the U.S. eased to nine in November, down from ten in October, with distressed exchanges remaining the primary cause of defaults in 2025. S&P Global Ratings projects the U.S. trailing 12-month speculative-grade corporate default rate to decrease to 4.0% by September 2026.</li>
                <li>Gold prices reached record highs in 2025, climbing about 60% to well over $4,000 a troy ounce, driven by persistent geopolitical tensions, political uncertainty, expectations of falling interest rates, and significant central bank purchasing.</li>

            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
                <li>The Israeli tech sector experienced a significant boom in 2025, with total exits surging to nearly $59 billion, largely propelled by Alphabet's $32 billion acquisition of cloud security firm Wiz, marking the largest deal ever for an Israeli-founded startup.</li>
                <li>The PwC Israel annual exit review reported a revival in IPOs, with seven listings this year achieving a combined valuation of $14.6 billion, a substantial increase from the previous year. Noteworthy Nasdaq debuts included travel and expense platform Navan ($6.2 billion) and trading app eToro ($4.4 billion).</li>
                <li>Israeli cybersecurity company Cyera has reportedly tripled its valuation within the past year, and is currently raising $400 million at an estimated $9 billion valuation.</li>
                <li>Nvidia is anticipated to announce plans for constructing Israel's largest server farm, a $1.5 billion project (NIS 4.84 billion) near Yokneam, designed to house its advanced Blackwell processors and a supercomputer.</li>
                <li>Israel's Consumer Price Index declined by 0.5% in November 2025, and home prices have fallen for the eighth consecutive month, indicating a cooling in inflation and housing markets.</li>
                <li>An administrator has filed a lawsuit against Slice management for NIS 1 billion, citing it as "an unprecedented fraud in the Israeli capital market" involving NIS 620 million lost by 7,500 clients in overseas alternative investment funds.</li>
                <li>Foreign investors' stock purchases on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) reached $2.3 billion in 2025, with optimism that a switch to Monday-Friday trading could further accelerate this trend. While the TA 35 gained 0.33% on December 16, it had fallen 0.51% on December 15. The TASE itself is currently valued richly, having seen its shares increase by 4% in the last month and 18% over the past three months.</li>
