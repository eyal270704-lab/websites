      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>Global markets generally saw gains, primarily fueled by increasing hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December and renewed enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) related stocks.</li>
        <li>U.S. stock markets were closed today, November 27, for the Thanksgiving holiday, but closed broadly higher on Wednesday, led by technology and AI stocks. U.S. markets will have an early close on Black Friday.</li>
        <li>Most Asian markets advanced, with Japan's Nikkei 225, South Korea's Kospi, Shanghai Composite, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng all recording positive movements.</li>
        <li>European shares showed mixed performance; Germany's DAX climbed, while the UK's FTSE 100 and France's CAC 40 saw slight declines.</li>
        <li>The Federal Reserve's anecdotal economic survey for November indicated a sputtering job market and moderate inflation.</li>
        <li>The Bank of Korea maintained its policy rate at 2.50% for the fourth consecutive meeting, simultaneously raising its growth and inflation forecasts.</li>
        <li>Oil prices retreated amidst optimism surrounding Russia-Ukraine peace talks and an increase in U.S. crude oil supplies.</li>
        <li>Bitcoin surged above $90,000, breaking a four-week losing streak, even as U.S. stock markets were closed for the holiday.</li>
        <li>Silver extended its gains, trading near its record high, also boosted by rate-cut sentiment.</li>
