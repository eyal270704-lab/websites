            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Positive Equity Outlook:</strong> J.P. Morgan Global Research forecasts double-digit gains for global equities in 2026, driven by robust earnings growth, anticipated lower interest rates, declining policy headwinds, and the continued rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Morgan Stanley also anticipates continued equity gains, with the S&P 500 potentially reaching around 7,500.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Interest Rate Expectations:</strong> Interest rates are generally expected to fall through 2026, which should provide support for equities. However, concerns about stubborn inflation and weaker economic growth in the U.S. and U.K. persist.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">AI's Role:</strong> The AI-driven supercycle is noted for fueling record capital expenditure and rapid earnings expansion across diverse industries. While AI is expected to significantly impact market performance, 2026 is viewed as the "show me" year for AI scalability and real-world implementation beyond initial capital expenditure. There are also cautionary notes regarding a potential AI-driven tech bubble.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Emerging Markets Strength:</strong> Emerging markets are poised for robust performance in 2026, buoyed by lower local interest rates, higher earnings growth, and attractive valuations.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Commodity Performance:</strong> Gold prices saw a significant surge in 2025, reaching a record $4,410 an ounce, but gains are expected to moderate in 2026 amid easing inflation. Silver also experienced a sharp rally in 2025, signaling a structural turning point.</li>
                <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Real Estate Rebound:</strong> Commercial real estate markets are showing a rebound, with global investment forecast to rise 15% to over $1 trillion as falling interest rates aid recovery.</li>
