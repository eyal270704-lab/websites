                        <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">US Markets Retreat:</span> US equities closed lower as an early CPI-driven rally faded, with the Dow leading losses (-0.82%), followed by the S&P 500 (-0.22%) and Nasdaq (-0.18%). Financials notably lagged due to an earnings miss from JPMorgan, while the energy sector outperformed amidst rising crude strength and Iran tensions. US equity futures are slightly negative.

                        <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">European Markets Mixed:</span> The DAX is consolidating within an uptrend, maintaining a bullish bias. Euro Stoxx 50 futures remained flat. The FTSE 100 hit a new record high above 10,170, primarily boosted by mining stocks following strong Chinese trade data. However, the broader UK market experienced volatility, with the FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices slipping due to weak trade data from China, reflecting global economic uncertainties.

                        <span class="font-semibold text-gray-900">Asian Markets Mostly Up:</span> Asia-Pacific markets generally showed strength. Japan's Nikkei surged by 1.7% amid speculation of a snap election, marking its best start to the year since 1990. China reported a record trade surplus of $1.2 trillion in 2025, defying high-level tariffs, though Shanghai reversed its all-time high after a margin rule change. South Korea's Kospi and Hong Kong's Hang Seng indices also traded higher.
