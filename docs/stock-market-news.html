        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
          <li>World stock markets experienced a mixed day on Friday, with underlying hopes for sustained U.S. central bank rate cuts tempered by persistent inflationary concerns.</li>
          <li>U.S. major indices finished modestly higher, with the S&P 500 climbing 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rising 0.3% following a tame inflation report that bolstered expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut next week.</li>
          <li>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, rose to an annual 2.8% in September, up from 2.7% in August, indicating a "sticky inflation situation" to analysts.</li>
          <li>In significant corporate news, Netflix announced an $83 billion takeover of Warner Bros. Discovery, marking the largest consolidation in the entertainment sector this decade; Netflix shares fell approximately 3%, while Warner Bros. Discovery stock jumped 6.3%.</li>
          <li>Mumbai equities gained after the Indian central bank implemented a rate cut, and shares of Chinese AI chipmaker Moore Threads Technology soared over 500% on its Shanghai market debut after a $1.1 billion IPO.</li>
          <li>Copper prices reached a new record high due to fears of a global supply squeeze. Gold prices have surged 60% in 2025 to $4,193 per ounce, driven by economic growth worries, falling interest rates, and geopolitical factors.</li>
          <li>The global cryptocurrency market cap saw a 2.08% decrease over the last 24 hours, now standing at $3.04 trillion, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading at $89,619, down 1.85%. LUNC, LUNA, and ACE were notable outperformers in the crypto market.</li>
          <li>Economic growth cooled in 2025 to 2.1%, and the Federal Reserve initiated slow rate cuts in late 2025. Early adoption of AI is enhancing productivity in specific sectors, though these gains are not yet widespread.</li>
          <li>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) conducted mock trading sessions on December 6, 2025, across various segments to test trading applications and new features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 border-b-2 border-purple-500 pb-2">Israeli Capital Market & Related News</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
          <li>An Israeli defense firm, Israel Weapon Industries (IWI), announced plans to begin supplying the first batch of 40,000 Light Machine Guns (LMGs) to India early next year and is nearing a contract for approximately 170,000 new-age carbines.</li>
          <li>While not directly capital market news from today, the Doha Forum 2025 featured discussions on the Gaza ceasefire, with Qatar's Prime Minister stating that a truce is incomplete without a full withdrawal of Israeli forces, which could indirectly influence regional economic sentiment.</li>
          <li>(Note: Specific real-time Israeli capital market news for December 06, 2025, beyond the defense deal, was not prominently found in the latest search results. Older reports from June and November 2025 regarding market jumps or growth forecast downgrades were observed but fall outside the "last 24 hours" requirement).</li>
