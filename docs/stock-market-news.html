          <li>
            <strong class="text-gray-900">US Market Performance Mixed:</strong> The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw gains, but the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 declined, largely due to concerns over the valuation of technology and AI-centric stocks. Sector-wise, Technology, Communication, and Health Care indices tumbled, while Energy, Materials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities advanced.
          </li>
          <li>

          <li>
            <strong class="text-gray-900">Commodity Fluctuations:</strong> Brent crude oil prices dropped. Precious metals saw dramatic declines, with both silver and gold falling. Conversely, natural gas prices gained for the third consecutive session.

            <strong class="text-gray-900">Economic Outlook & Risks:</strong> The global economy is characterized by moderating inflation and gradual, albeit uneven, monetary easing. Capital is increasingly shifting towards resilient, income-generating sectors such as digital and energy infrastructure, sports assets, and real estate. Concerns were noted regarding high valuations and potential tariffs under a Trump presidency, which could pressure the S&P 500 in 2026.
