            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-3 text-lg">
                <li>On December 18, 2025, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's TA-35 index closed at 3,661.68, marking a 0.73% increase.</li>
                <li>2025 is emerging as a peak year for the Israeli stock market, with leading indices experiencing rises of 50% and breaking records not seen in two decades, largely due to substantial capital inflows and a reduced risk premium.</li>
                <li>The strong performance of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange contributed to Israel's ranking as the third-best performing economy in 2025 by "The Economist."</li>
                <li>Foreign investment in Israeli stocks reached $2.3 billion in 2025. Foreign financial institutions have significantly increased their holdings, particularly in the financial sector, with the Banks5 Index jumping 71% and the Insurance Index soaring 165% this year.</li>

This strength is attributed to significant foreign investment, reduced geopolitical risks following the war with Iran and a Gaza ceasefire, strong stock market performance, and robust Q3 GDP growth.</li>
                <li>However, the strong shekel poses challenges for export profitability, potentially prompting intervention from the Bank of Israel.</li>
