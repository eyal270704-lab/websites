      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>U.S. stock futures experienced a notable decline early Monday, with S&P 500 futures falling 0.6-0.7%, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures down 0.5-0.6%, and Nasdaq composite futures slipping 0.9-1.1%. This downturn was primarily attributed to a criminal probe involving Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and heightened geopolitical tensions in Iran.</li>
        <li>Conversely, Asian markets largely surged. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index gained 1.2-1.4%, and the Shanghai Composite index jumped 1-1.1%, following reports of potential economic support measures from Chinese leaders. Mainland China's daily stock trading volume also hit a record high of $521.80 billion. Tokyo's markets were closed for a holiday.</li>
        <li>European markets showed a mixed performance, with Germany's DAX nearly flat, while the CAC 40 in Paris shed 0.5%, and Britain's FTSE 100 edged 0.1% lower.</li>
        <li>Safe-haven assets saw significant gains: Gold rose 1.9-2.3%, hitting a record high, silver jumped 6.3-6.4%, and copper was up 1.4%.</li>
        <li>Oil prices, specifically U.S. benchmark crude, saw initial gains but later fell, while Brent crude traded around $63.25-$63.43 per barrel. Geopolitical risks in the Middle East, particularly involving Iran, continue to influence crude prices.</li>
        <li>The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield was up, hovering near 4.19%.</li>
        <li>The Q4 earnings season is set to kick off this week, with major banks such as JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley scheduled to report their results.</li>
        <li>Emerging market business confidence remained subdued at the end of 2025 and heading into 2026, marking the lowest confidence since comparable data began in 2012, largely due to U.S. tariffs announced in April 2025. Employment levels in emerging markets continued to see cuts.</li>
