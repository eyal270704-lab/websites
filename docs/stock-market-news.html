        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
          <li>Investors are keenly awaiting the Federal Reserve's final interest rate decision of 2025 today, with a high probability (87-89.6%) of a 25 basis point rate cut, which is expected to significantly influence market direction.</li>
          <li>U.S. markets experienced mixed performance; the S&P 500 remained largely unchanged or slightly down, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped by 0.4-0.44% partly due to JPMorgan's stock slide, while the Nasdaq composite saw slight gains of 0.1%.</li>
          <li>Asian shares were mostly lower in morning trade, with Japan's Nikkei 225 dropping 0.4%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng losing 0.4%, and the Shanghai Composite shedding 0.6%. South Korea's Kospi, however, showed a marginal increase.</li>
          <li>Indian equity markets initially opened with slight gains but later turned negative, with the Sensex falling over 200 points and the Nifty 50 declining by 0.47%. Mid-cap and small-cap indices displayed resilience.</li>
          <li>Commodity markets saw silver prices reaching record highs, which boosted Hindustan Zinc by 3%. Crude oil futures showed slight increases early on December 10, but later recorded minor dips.</li>
          <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Notable Stocks:</strong>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-black">
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Nvidia</strong> slipped 0.3% after receiving approval to sell an advanced AI chip (H200) to "approved customers" in China.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Exxon Mobil</strong> climbed 2% following an increased profit forecast for the next five years.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">JPMorgan Chase & Co.</strong> fell over 4% due to warnings about higher-than-expected costs and concerns over consumer fragility.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">GE Vernova Inc.</strong> rose over 6% after doubling its dividend, increasing share buybacks, and raising earnings projections.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Tata Power</strong> commissioned a new 400 kV transmission line.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Swiggy</strong> launched a ₹10,000 crore Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP).</li>

            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Market Trends:</strong> The overarching theme remains the anticipation of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. Experts suggest that further monetary easing and regulatory adjustments could support asset prices. In India, small-cap firms are predicted to underperform in 2026 due to high valuations and low liquidity, although fundamental indicators for India appear favorable.</li>
