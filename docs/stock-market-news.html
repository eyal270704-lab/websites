                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">The Dow Jones Industrial Average surged above 50,000 points for the first time on Friday, closing up 2.5%, while the S&P 500 gained 2% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 2.2%.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Chipmakers like Nvidia (+8%) and Broadcom (+7.1%) rallied, driven by expectations of continued AI spending. However, Amazon shares fell over 5% after projecting $200 billion in 2026 capital expenditures for AI, exceeding Wall Street estimates.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Concerns linger over the broader market, with the S&P 500 having traded sideways in 2026, and a high CAPE ratio in January 2026 (39.9) signaling a valuation level last seen during the dot-com crash of October 2000. Studies suggest President Trump's tariffs continue to impact U.S. companies and consumers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Consumer sentiment in February, while slightly up, remains historically low due to persistent worries about personal finances from high prices and job loss risks, though year-ahead inflation forecasts improved to 3.5%.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Bitcoin rebounded above $70,000 on Friday after a volatile week that saw a "historic collapse" in gold, silver, and crypto markets attributed partly to hawkish Federal Reserve Chair speculation. Oil prices also rose.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">In private capital markets, M&A activity is rebounding, especially in the US, but weak distributions are still a constraint. Investment is increasingly flowing into resilient, income-generating sectors such as digital and energy infrastructure, sports assets, and real estate.</p>

                <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Israel's macroeconomic fundamentals improved towards the end of 2025, supported by strong high-tech exports and easing inflation, leading to an upgrade in the country's credit outlook. The 2026 state budget passed its first reading.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
