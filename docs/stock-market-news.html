        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">U.S. Markets on December 24:</span> The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at new record highs in a pre-holiday shortened session, with the S&P 500 advancing 0.32% to 6,932.05 and the Dow gaining 0.60% to 48,731.16. The Nasdaq Composite also rose by 0.22% to 23,613.31. These gains were partly fueled by stronger-than-expected Q3 US GDP growth of 4.3%.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Holiday Closures & Liquidity:</span> Most major global equity markets, including those in the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, and Singapore, are closed today, December 26, for post-Christmas holidays, leading to fragmented liquidity. U.S. equity markets resumed normal trading today after being closed yesterday.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Asian Market Performance (December 26):</span> Japan's Nikkei 225 is trading higher by approximately 1%, with the broader Topix reaching a fresh record high. South Korea's Kospi is up by 0.70%, and China's blue-chip CSI 300 has seen a 0.60% increase.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">2025 Market Trends:</span> Risk assets concluded 2025 strongly, buoyed by expectations of gradual financial loosening in 2026, following the Federal Reserve's third consecutive rate cut in December. Gains were primarily concentrated in growth-sensitive sectors, particularly technology and AI. The US Dollar Index (USDX) saw a decline in the first half of 2025 but stabilized in the latter half, while crude oil prices ended the year under pressure due to demand concerns and increased non-OPEC output.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="font-semibold">Japan's Economic Outlook:</span> The Japanese cabinet has approved a record-high initial budget for the upcoming fiscal year, and the Bank of Japan Governor indicated the central bank is nearing its 2% inflation target, hinting at potential further interest rate increases.

          <span class="font-semibold">2025 Economic Performance:</span> "The Economist" ranked Israel's economy as the third-best performing economy in the OECD for 2025, largely attributing this to the Israeli stock market's impressive 53.3% increase, the highest among OECD countries. Israeli tech companies raised $15.6 billion in 2025.

S&P Global Ratings revised its outlook on Israel to stable from negative in November 2025, anticipating GDP growth to reach 5% in 2026. Inflation eased to 2.4% in November, supporting the case for continued monetary easing in early 2026. However, the housing market continues to show weakness with declining sales and falling home prices.
