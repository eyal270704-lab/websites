        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
          <li><strong>US Stocks Close Volatile Month:</strong> Wall Street extended gains for a fifth straight day, concluding a volatile November. The S&P 500 rose 0.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.6%, and the Nasdaq saw a 0.7% increase on Friday. However, the Nasdaq ended November down 1.5%, primarily due to significant losses in certain large technology stocks.</li>
          <li><strong>Tech Sector Mixed Performance:</strong> Stocks fueled by enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, such as Nvidia, faced concerns over their high valuations, with Nvidia dropping 1.8% on Friday and experiencing a double-digit loss for November. Oracle fell 23% and Palantir Technologies declined 16% in November. Conversely, Alphabet notably rose nearly 14% for the month, driven by excitement surrounding its Gemini AI model. Alibaba's cloud computing revenue surged by 34% year-on-year, propelled by triple-digit growth in AI-related products.</li>
          <li><strong>Anticipated Fed Rate Cuts:</strong> Investor optimism for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in December intensified, with traders assigning an almost 87% probability to a 0.25% reduction, signalling a more dovish monetary policy outlook.</li>
          <li><strong>Sector Rotation:</strong> Amid the tech sector's volatility, capital shifted into other market segments. Pharmaceutical giants Eli Lilly and Merck each recorded monthly gains exceeding 20%, while travel companies like Marriott and Expedia also posted strong performances.</li>
          <li><strong>Cryptocurrency Market Recovers:</strong> The cryptocurrency market exhibited a buying bias and a short-term recovery as November drew to a close, bolstered by expectations of a more accommodative US monetary policy and reduced attractiveness of safe-haven assets. Bitcoin's Open Interest recovered to $29.3 billion. The global crypto market cap currently stands at $3.08 trillion, with Bitcoin trading around $90,537.</li>
          <li><strong>Indian Markets Reach New Highs:</strong> India's Sensex and Nifty indices hit all-time highs, extending their rally for a third consecutive week. This surge was supported by positive global sentiment, strong domestic inflows, and optimism regarding India-US trade negotiations. Despite this, Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) were net sellers in Indian equities through November, with outflows of Rs 3,765 crore, though a potential shift in strategy is expected due to improving macroeconomic conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>B2B Software Underperforms:</strong> The B2B Software Index declined by approximately 1.8% in October 2025, lagging behind the broader S&P 500 and Nasdaq. While major players like Microsoft and Alphabet continued to outperform, many B2B software segments such as ERP and CRM faced pressure due to competitive risks from Generative AI.</li>
          <li><strong>Strong IPO Activity:</strong> Global IPO activity continues to strengthen in 2025, with $54 billion raised across more than 300 listings, surpassing 2024 levels.</li>

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-gray-900 border-b-2 border-purple-500 pb-3">Israeli Capital Markets</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
          <li><strong>Robust Economic Growth:</strong> Israel's economy is demonstrating strong growth, with its technology sector contributing nearly 20% to the GDP. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has seen a surge of over 80% to all-time highs since October 7, 2023. Israeli start-ups successfully raised over $12 billion in 2024, marking a 31% increase from the previous year.</li>
          <li><strong>Significant International Investments:</strong> Billionaire investor Bill Ackman's $25 million investment in the TASE, made 110 days into the Israel-Hamas War, has yielded over 100% returns. Additionally, Sequoia Capital doubled its exposure in Israel after October 7.</li>
          <li><strong>Tech Sector Dominance:</strong> Israeli tech stocks outperformed, delivering a 15.8% return in 2024, surpassing the NASDAQ 100's 9.4%. A notable development includes Google's recent acquisition of Israeli cybersecurity firm Wiz for $32 billion.</li>
          <li><strong>Interest Rate Cut:</strong> On November 24, 2025, the Bank of Israel reduced its policy rate from 4.50% to 4.25%, marking the first cut since early 2024. This decision was influenced by inflation stabilising within the target range, with further rate cuts anticipated before the end of 2026.</li>
          <li><strong>New Defense Index Faces Initial Dip:</strong> A new index, ת”א-ביטחוניות (TA-Security), launched in November on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, featuring approximately 20 leading defense and security technology companies. However, it experienced an initial decline of 4-5% due to geopolitical signals surrounding potential peace negotiations in Ukraine-Russia and discussions about ending the war in Gaza, leading investors to project a slowdown in demand for defense products. Despite this, the sector's fundamentals are considered strong, supported by increasing global defense budgets and expanding exports of Israeli defense technologies.</li>
          <li><strong>TASE Performance (November 26, 2025):</strong> The TA 35 index recorded a gain of 0.88%. Among the top performers were Tower Semiconductor Ltd (+7.38%), Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (+4.24%), and Nova (+4.23%).</li>
          <li><strong>Strengthening India-Israel Economic Ties:</strong> India and Israel are deepening their economic relationship through ongoing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) discussions and the establishment of a new bilateral investment framework.</li>
