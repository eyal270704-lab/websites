          <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Positive Start to 2026 on Wall Street:</strong> U.S. markets began the year with optimism, largely driven by the ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) rally.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index also climbed, driven by technology stocks such as Alibaba and Baidu, which surged after announcing a spin-off of its AI chip unit. Many other major Asian markets, including Shanghai, Shenzhen, Nikkei, and Hang Seng, had no trading on Saturday, January 3, 2026.
