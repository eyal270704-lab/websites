            Okay, I will provide a summary of the most important capital market news from the last 24 hours, focusing on major headlines, notable stocks, and market trends, presented as a bullet point list in Markdown format, using Tailwind CSS for styling, and tailored for October 31, 2025.

Here's a summary of the most important capital market news from the last 24 hours, focusing on major headlines, notable stocks, and market trends, tailored for October 31, 2025:

    *   European stocks were indicated to open slightly weaker.
*   **US Market Performance (October 30, 2025):**
