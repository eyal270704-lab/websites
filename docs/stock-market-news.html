            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Global Capital Market Highlights</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
                <li>The S&P 500 recently achieved two new highs, extending its potential bull run to seven months and an 87.5% gain since October 2022.</li>
                <li>Non-U.S. markets outpaced U.S. equities, signaling a shift by investors from small-cap and domestic stocks towards large-cap and foreign equities.</li>
                <li>Precious metals, particularly silver, led asset class returns, with silver notably surpassing Apple in global market capitalization rankings.</li>
                <li>Copper has seen significant gains in 2025, surging over 30% year-to-date on Comex and 42% on LME to reach record highs, driven by supply constraints, shifting demand, and investment inflows.</li>
                <li>Investor sentiment shows a rotation from blockchain assets to precious metals, and from Consumer Staples to Materials sectors.</li>
                <li>Approximately US$1 trillion was pulled from active equity mutual funds in 2025, while passive equity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) received over US$600 billion, as active managers struggled to keep pace with the market's concentration in a few mega-cap tech stocks.</li>
                <li>Warren Buffett's recent portfolio adjustments indicate caution, with increased cash levels and reduced buybacks suggesting concerns about market valuations. He has been strategically rotating out of technology and into value-oriented businesses facing short-term challenges, including UnitedHealth Group, homebuilding, and steel, alongside a major investment in Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s OxyChem business.</li>
                <li>The global cryptocurrency market cap saw a slight increase of 0.68% over the last 24 hours, with Bitcoin (BTC) trading around $87,883, up 0.36%, despite a nearly 30% pullback from its record highs in 2025.</li>
                <li>U.S. GDP growth accelerated to an annualized 4.3% in the third quarter, surpassing expectations due to strong consumer spending and business investments.</li>
                <li>S&P 500 earnings are projected to rise by 13.2% in 2025 and further accelerate to 15.5% in 2026, primarily driven by continued robust demand in the technology sector, fueled by artificial intelligence (AI).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Capital Market Highlights</h2>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
                <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) concluded the previous week (Thursday, December 26) with notable declines, as the TA-35 index fell 3.1%, the TA-90 dropped approximately 2.7%, and the TA-125 slid 2.8%.</li>
                <li>These losses were primarily driven by a downward correction in insurance stocks and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's warning to potentially double a planned tax on banks' excess profits if they retract customer benefit packages.</li>
                <li>The TA Insurance index experienced a 6.8% fall, with leading insurers such as Migdal, Clal, Phoenix, and Harel seeing significant drops in value.</li>
                <li>The TA Banks index also declined by 4.2%, affecting major banks including Mizrahi Tefahot, Hapoalim, Discount, Leumi, and the International Bank of Israel.</li>
                <li>Israeli private equity firm AP Partners achieved significant success by completing two exits in December, generating close to NIS 315 million ($98.6 million) in profit, and plans to raise a third fund targeting $350-400 million.</li>
                <li>TurboGen Ltd. signed a crucial license agreement with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, gaining rights to integrate TG40 micro-turbine technology into defense projects for the IDF and Ministry of Defense.</li>
                <li>The Israeli economy is showing signs of transitioning to a more stable growth phase, with November inflation easing to 2.4% and a tight labor market, while the housing market continues to weaken.</li>
                <li>As of January 4, 2026, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will shift its trading days from Sunday-Thursday to Monday-Friday.</li>
