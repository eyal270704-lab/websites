            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">U.S. Stocks Trade Muted Post-Christmas:</strong> Major U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite, closed near record peaks on Friday, December 27th, in a quiet post-Christmas trading session. Despite slight daily dips, all three indexes are poised for double-digit percentage gains for the year. The S&P 500 has surged nearly 18% in 2025, largely propelled by megacap technology companies and optimism surrounding artificial intelligence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">AI Enthusiasm and Fed Rate Cut Expectations:</strong> The market rally has been significantly fueled by AI enthusiasm, with projections for substantial AI infrastructure spending, and expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2026.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Valuation Concerns:</strong> Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell issued warnings in 2025 regarding elevated stock valuations. The S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio of 39.4 in December suggests potential market declines in 2026 and 2027 based on historical patterns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Precious Metals Hit All-Time Highs:</strong> Gold and silver surged to record levels on Friday, December 27th. Gold reached a record $4,549 per ounce before a slight easing, while silver climbed 9% to $76.88 an ounce, driven by rate cut expectations and safe-haven demand amidst geopolitical tensions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Oil Prices Decline:</strong> Crude oil prices settled over 2% lower due to concerns about a global supply glut.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">European and Asian Market Closures:</strong> Most major European markets (DAX, FTSE 100, Paris CAC 40) and several Asian markets (Shanghai, Hang Seng, Nikkei, KOSPI, Indian markets) were closed on December 27th, extending the Christmas holiday period, leading to thin trading volumes globally.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Taiwanese Market Outperformance:</strong> Taiwan's stock market has notably outperformed Japan and South Korea over the last four years, with the Taiex index rising approximately 120% since 2022, mainly attributed to robust growth in artificial intelligence hardware.

          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Mixed TASE Performance:</strong> The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) saw its leading indices, TA-35 and TA-90, rise on December 24th. However, on December 25th, TASE indices experienced significant declines of up to 2%, with the TA-35, TA-125, and TA-Banks indices falling notably. This downturn was linked to a correction in insurance company stocks and a potential new tax on bank profits proposed by the Finance Minister.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Strong Economic Ranking Despite Challenges:</strong> The Economist ranked Israel as the third-strongest economy globally in 2025, highlighting its stock market as the world's top performer with a strong recovery from 2023. The TA-125 index gained 49% and the TA-35 index soared over 50% in 2025, attracting foreign investment.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Capital Outflows and Economic Instability:</strong> Despite positive rankings, foreign investors offloaded approximately 2 billion shekels ($589 million) worth of shares on the TASE from June to July 2025, marking a significant capital outflow. This is largely attributed to escalating regional tensions, security concerns, and economic instability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Slowdown in Tech and Startup Ecosystem:</strong> Israel's technology and startup sector experienced a slowdown in deal activity and investment throughout 2025, with total funding nearly stagnating around $6 billion and a noticeable decline in exit values.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Nvidia's Expansion:</strong> Nvidia announced plans to establish a new campus in Kiryat Tivon, Israel, capable of accommodating up to 10,000 employees, underscoring Israel's technological prowess.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Inflation Easing:</strong> Israel's inflation rate eased to 2.4% in November, which may support further monetary easing by the central bank in early 2026.
