            Okay, I will provide a summary of the most important capital market news from the last 24 hours, focusing on major headlines, notable stocks, and market trends, presented as a bullet point list in Markdown format. I will use Google Search to find current, real-time information from November 2, 2025, and tailor the response to include both global and Israeli capital market news. I will also ensure the output adheres to the specified HTML/Tailwind CSS requirements.

Here's a summary of the capital market news, formatted as requested:

### Global Capital Market News (November 2, 2025)

*   **Overall Market Sentiment:** Global markets are showing mixed signals. Some sources indicate a cautious note due to profit booking after a strong rally, while others highlight continued strength in specific sectors like technology.
*   **US Market:** The US stock market ended October 2025 with strong gains, particularly in technology shares. The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones Industrial Average all extended their winning streaks. November is historically a strong month for US stocks.
*   **Key Stocks:**
    *   **Amazon (AMZN):** Surged after better-than-expected Q3 results, driven by its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division.
    *   **Nvidia (NVDA):** Briefly surpassed a $5T market valuation.
    *   **Tesla (TSLA):** Advanced, supported by expectations of stronger EV demand.
    *   **Fiserv (FI):** Plunged after missing Q3 estimates and announcing a strategic overhaul.
    *   **Dexcom (DXCM):** Fell due to a cautious 2026 growth outlook.
*   **Sector Performance:**
    *   **Technology:** Continues to lead the market higher, driven by AI, cloud computing, and semiconductors.
    *   **Consumer Discretionary:** Expected to outperform with the approaching holiday season.
    *   **Healthcare & Industrials:** Also expected to perform well in November.
    *   **Defensive Sectors (Consumer Staples, Utilities):** Lagging behind in the rally.
    *   **Energy:** Showing signs of a potential "dead cat bounce."
    *   **Defense:** Seasonality suggests a strong November for the defense sector.
*   **Market Trends:**
    *   **Growth vs. Value:** Growth stocks are outperforming value stocks.
    *   **Foreign Markets:** Investors rotated out of foreign markets recently.
    *   **Commodities:** Crude oil and gasoline have increased, while gold and silver have seen some losses.
    *   **Cryptocurrencies/Blockchain:** Blockchain companies have surged.
*   **Asian Markets:**
    *   **South Korea (KOSPI):** Experienced record highs followed by profit-taking. Technology and export-oriented firms led the gains.
    *   **Hong Kong (Hang Seng Index):** Ended October on a weak note due to weak China data and tech stock selling.
    *   **Singapore (Straits Times Index):** Banks are not the main drivers; real estate and REITs are contributing significantly.
*   **MENA Region:** The region saw 11 IPOs in Q3 2025, raising $0.7 billion.
*   **Global Economy:** Concerns about potential credit shocks, job market weakness, and declining rent prices are being monitored.

### Israeli Capital Market News (November 2, 2025)

*   **TA-125 Index:** The TA-125 index had previously surged to record highs despite tensions in West Asia, but no specific news updates for November 2, 2025 were found. Recent information focused on the index performance amidst geopolitical tensions and US involvement in the region from earlier in the year.
*   **Geopolitical Impact:** The Israeli market's performance has been influenced by geopolitical tensions.
*   **Hamas Conflict:** Recent reports indicate that remains returned by Hamas were confirmed not to be those of hostages, which strains the US-brokered ceasefire.

I have focused on providing the most recent information available while adhering to the date constraints. Some information may be limited due to the specific date requirement.
