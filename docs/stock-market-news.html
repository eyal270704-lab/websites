        <li>U.S. stock markets closed mixed on Wednesday, February 4, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite declining due to investor concerns over the high valuation of technology and AI-centric stocks.</li>
        <li>The Dow Jones Industrial Average, however, posted a gain, reflecting a broader sector rotation in the market.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) reached record highs last year (2025), outperforming global markets, including the U.S., despite regional conflicts. The TA-35 Index surged by 51.6% and the TA-90 Index increased by 46.6% in 2025.</li>
        <li>Since the initial market plunge following October 7, 2023, the TA-35 index has surged 98%, and the TA-90 index jumped 94%.</li>
        <li>Foreign investors purchased $1.27 billion in local shares last year, primarily in the financial and defense sectors.</li>
        <li>On Wednesday, February 4, the TA 35 index gained 0.02% to hit a new all-time high, driven by strong performance in the banking, financials, and insurance sectors.</li>
        <li>Notable advancers on the TASE on February 4 included Leumi (TASE:LUMI) up 2.89%, Israel Discount Bank Ltd (TASE:DSCT) rising 2.86%, and Bezeq Israeli Telecommunication Corp Ltd (TASE:BEZQ) increasing by 2.65%.</li>
        <li>Conversely, Tower Semiconductor Ltd (TASE:TSEM) fell 5.60%, Newmed Energy LP (TASE:NWMDp) declined 4.39%, and Nova (TASE:NVMI) was down 4.38%.</li>
        <li>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) projects Israel's economy to grow by 4.8% in 2026, an increase from 2.9% in 2025, with inflation expected to fall below 2% in 2026.</li>
        <li>Moody's upgraded the rating for Phoenix Insurance, a subsidiary of Israel-based Phoenix Financial Ltd. (TLV:PHOE), to A3 with a stable outlook. This places Phoenix Insurance one notch above the Government of Israel's sovereign rating, reflecting its strong financial performance and market position.</li>
        <li>The IMF noted that Israel's draft 2026 Budget deficit ceiling of 3.9% of GDP is a step in the right direction but is considered insufficient to put the public debt ratio on a downward trajectory.</li>
