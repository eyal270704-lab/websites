      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
        <li>Major U.S. stock indexes experienced slight dips on Friday, December 27, after earlier reaching near-record highs, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all closing marginally lower.</li>
        <li>Trading volume in U.S. markets was muted due to the post-Christmas holiday period.</li>
        <li>Many European markets, including the DAX, FTSE 100, and Paris CAC 40, along with several Asian markets such as the Shanghai Composite and Nikkei 225, were closed on December 27 for public holidays.</li>
        <li>Precious metals continued their strong performance, with gold and silver reaching new record highs. Gold traded around $4,549 per ounce, and silver surged by 9% to $76.88 per ounce, driven by expectations of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, a weaker dollar, and safe-haven demand. Analysts anticipate this rally could extend into 2026.</li>
        <li>Oil prices saw a decline of over 2%, influenced by concerns about a global supply glut and potential progress in a Ukraine peace deal. Brent Crude was noted at approximately $58.38 per barrel.</li>
        <li>Investors are closely monitoring signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve regarding potential interest rate cuts in 2026, with at least two cuts currently priced in by traders, though not expected before June.</li>
        <li>The artificial intelligence (AI) boom significantly contributed to the net worth of U.S. tech billionaires in 2025, adding an estimated $500 billion. Taiwan's stock market has outperformed Japan and South Korea, largely benefiting from its robust AI hardware sector and significant role in AI server assembly.</li>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Capital Market News</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) experienced significant declines on December 25, with the TA-35 index falling 3.13% and the TA-90 down 2.77%. Overall, major indices on the TASE dropped by up to 2% on that day, including a 1.8% fall for the TA-35 and 2.2% for TA-Banks.</li>
        <li>These declines were partly attributed to a downward correction in insurance company stocks, which had seen substantial gains throughout 2025, resulting in the TA-Insurance index dropping over 5%.</li>
        <li>Concerns also arose from Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's threat to impose higher taxes on bank profits if they withdraw committed customer benefits packages, which led to drops in bank stock values.</li>
        <li>Despite recent market dips, The Economist ranked Israel as the world's third strongest economy in 2025, highlighting its stock market as the top performer globally and noting a strong recovery from the challenges of 2023.</li>
        <li>In 2025, the TA-125 index gained 49%, and the TA-35 index of blue-chip companies soared over 50%.</li>
        <li>While foreign investors significantly contributed to the Israeli market throughout the year, an approximate 2 billion shekel ($589 million) outflow from the TASE between June and July 2025 indicated some foreign investors reconsidering their exposure due to regional tensions and economic instability.</li>
        <li>Nvidia announced plans to establish a campus in Kiryat Tivon, with the capacity for up to 10,000 employees, underscoring Israel's recognized technological prowess.</li>
        <li>The Israeli technology and startup ecosystem experienced a slowdown in deal activity and capital raising in 2025, with total funding stabilizing around $6 billion.</li>
        <li>The TASE introduced a new "Trading at Last (TAL)" phase in August 2025 to enable trades at a security's closing price, aiming to enhance liquidity and transparency and align with international trading standards.</li>
