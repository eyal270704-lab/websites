            Okay, I will summarize the most important capital market news from the last 24 hours, focusing on major headlines, notable stocks, and market trends. I will present the answer as a bullet point list in Markdown format, using Tailwind CSS classes for styling. I will use Google Search to find current, real-time information from October 30, 2025, and ensure the information is up-to-date.

Here's a summary of the capital market news from the last 24 hours, focusing on global and Israeli markets:

### Global Capital Market News:

*   **Market Performance:** Global markets showed mixed performance. The U.S. market ended on a mixed note on Wednesday following a Federal Reserve rate cut. European markets traded lower. Asian markets also saw mixed performance following the Fed's cautious stance on future rate cuts.
*   **Federal Reserve's Impact:** The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 25 bps, but Chairman Jerome Powell hinted it might be the last cut of 2025, leading to market consolidation and a risk-off sentiment across emerging markets. This tempered hopes of further monetary easing.
*   **US-China Trade Talks:** Investors remained cautious ahead of updates on U.S.-China trade talks. However, there were some positive developments as President Trump hailed his meeting with President Xi Jinping as a success, announcing reduced tariffs on Chinese goods and China resuming purchases of soybeans and rare earth materials.
*   **Nvidia's Milestone:** Nvidia became the first company to achieve a $5 trillion market capitalization, boosting the Nasdaq.
*   **Cryptocurrency Market:** The global cryptocurrency market cap decreased by 1.39% to $3.80T. Bitcoin traded between $107,925 and $113,644.

### Israeli Capital Market News:

*   **Kadimastem Merger:** NLS Pharmaceutics and Kadimastem announced the completion of material conditions for their merger transaction. Trading in Kadimastem’s shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) will be suspended, with final delisting from the TASE on October 31, 2025. The combined company, NewCelX Ltd., will be listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol "NCEL" starting October 31, 2025.
*   **Gasoline Prices:** Gasoline prices in Israel are set to fall on Saturday night, bringing the price of 95 octane gasoline back to its August 2024 level, the lowest in nearly two years. The maximum price will fall by NIS 0.17 per liter to NIS 7.07 per liter.
*   **Winvia Funding:** Sagi's Winvia raised £40m at a company valuation of £205m.

### Indian Market Updates:

*   **Market Overview:** Indian benchmark indices, Sensex and Nifty50, settled sharply lower, tracking weak global cues. The Sensex fell 593 points, and the Nifty closed below 25,900.
*   **Key Factors Influencing Market:** The decline was influenced by the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cut and cautious outlook, fresh foreign fund outflows, and uncertainty surrounding U.S.-China trade talks.
*   **Sectoral Performance:** Most sectoral indices settled in the red, except for Nifty Energy. Nifty Financial Services and IT sectors were among the major drags.
*   **Stock Recommendations:** Nuvama Professional Clients Group recommended ONGC, Graphite India, and SAIL as top buy calls.
