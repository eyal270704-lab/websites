          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Major Indices:</span> The S&P 500 concluded the past week with a modest 0.1% gain, yet displayed underlying sector weaknesses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average saw a decrease of approximately 1%, while the Nasdaq was down 0.11% for the week.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Market Trends & Rotations:</span> Funds have shifted from small-cap stocks, value-oriented investments, energy, and foreign equities towards the Nasdaq, the "Magnificent Seven" (Mag 7), growth stocks, consumer discretionary, and precious metals. High-beta and growth sectors showed stronger performance, contrasting with the lagging small-cap and value segments. Consumer Discretionary was a leading sector, while energy experienced the most significant decline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Economic Indicators:</span> Mixed economic signals persist in the U.S., with unemployment rising to 4.6% in November. November's nonfarm payroll report indicated 64,000 new jobs, surpassing expectations, despite a loss of 105,000 jobs in October. Average hourly earnings slowed to 0.1% in November. Retail sales were flat for November, though core retail sales increased by 0.4%. Annualized inflation in November stood at 2.7%, lower than the projected 3.1%.

The Fed also resumed purchases of short-term U.S. Treasury securities. In a contrasting move, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate to just under 0.75%. The Bank of England reduced its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.75%, while the European Union maintained its rate at 2.15%.

        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-black">
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Foreign Investment Surge:</span> Foreign investors acquired $2.3 billion in Israeli stocks in 2025, with their holdings in non-dual-listed stocks rising by 70% in U.S. dollar terms during the first nine months. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) anticipates that the upcoming transition to Monday-Friday trading will further boost this trend.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Shekel Strength:</span> The Israeli shekel is nearing a four-year high against the U.S. dollar, trading at 3.22, marking an over 10% appreciation in the past year. Analysts largely foresee continued strengthening of the shekel, attributed to robust real and financial investments, reduced hedging costs, and strong U.S. stock markets. While this strength helps mitigate inflation and reflects economic resilience, it negatively impacts export profitability.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">TASE Performance:</span> 2025 is proving to be a banner year for the Israeli stock market, with leading indices surging by 50% and setting new records. The Banks5 Index climbed 71%, and the Insurance Index remarkably soared by 165% this year. As of December 17, 2025, the TA-35 index recorded a 0.77% increase, and the TA-90 index was up 0.88%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Key Sectors & Companies:</span> Foreign investors are heavily concentrated in the financial sector, holding 70% of their Israeli investments, with 56% specifically in the five largest Israeli banks. Top-performing stocks in foreign portfolios include Phoenix Financial (up 186%), Harel (up 180%), Clal Insurance (up 155%), and Menora Mivtachim (up 187%).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Economic Activity:</span> Israel's economic activity index showed a 0.5% increase in November, driven by strong goods exports, favorable labor market data, and gains in the stock market. The Consumer Price Index saw a 0.5% decrease in November.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="font-semibold">Company & Project News:</span> Awz has announced plans for a $1.5 billion advanced chip factory in Ashkelon, which will focus on III–V semiconductors for defense and AI applications, although specifics on funding and technical partners are still pending. Elbit Systems reportedly secured a defense contract with an undisclosed Arab state, potentially marking a significant first in Israeli defense industry relations.
