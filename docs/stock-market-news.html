            <strong>U.S. Markets Faced Significant Declines:</strong> Wall Street experienced its worst day in three weeks on Friday, December 12, primarily due to a sell-off in technology stocks. The S&P 500 fell 1.1% from its all-time high, the Nasdaq Composite dropped by 1.7%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 0.5%.
          </li>

            <strong>Key Stock Movements:</strong>
            <ul class="list-circle list-inside ml-5 space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Broadcom (AVGO)</strong> tumbled 11.4% despite reporting stronger-than-expected quarterly profits, possibly due to investor concerns about future financial forecasts.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Nvidia (NVDA)</strong> shares fell 3.3%, extending worries about the broader artificial intelligence (AI) sector. Discussions are also ongoing regarding Nvidia's potential market performance in 2026.

              <li>
                <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Oracle (ORCL)</strong> saw its stock drop 4.5% after reporting revenues that fell short of expectations.

            <strong>Interest Rate Cuts and Bond Market Pressure:</strong> The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its main interest rate by 25 basis points for the third time this year, hinting at another potential cut in 2026. This move aimed to ease liquidity concerns and potentially boost foreign institutional investor (FII) inflows. However, rising yields on the 10-year Treasury, which climbed to 4.18%, continued to exert pressure on equity valuations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Indian Market Shows Bullish Tone:</strong> Indian equity benchmarks ended the week on a bullish note, with the Nifty surging 0.57% on Friday, bolstered by the U.S. Fed's rate cut. The Nifty closed at 26,046 and the Sensex at 85,267. India's year-on-year inflation rate (CPI) for November was estimated at 0.71%.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>European Market Performance:</strong> European indices generally experienced modest declines. While Germany's DAX saw a 0.66% gain, France's CAC 40 fell 0.57%, and the UK's FTSE 100 slipped 0.19%.
          </li>
