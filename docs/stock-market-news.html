        <li>
          <strong>U.S. Markets:</strong> U.S. stock futures experienced a slight dip early Monday, following the S&P 500's achievement of new record highs as 2025 draws to a close. Year-to-date, the S&P 500 is up 17.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 14.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite leads with a 22.2% increase. Market sentiment remains largely positive, bolstered by strength in metals, demand for AI chip stocks, and stable economic data. Trading activity is light due to holiday periods. Investors are looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's release of its December meeting minutes on Wednesday. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield saw a minor decrease, hovering around 4.11%. WTI crude oil futures were trending upward near $61.5 per barrel, while the Gold Spot U.S. dollar price slightly decreased to approximately $4,464 per ounce.

Indian equities extended losses for the fourth consecutive session, with the Sensex declining 0.41% and the Nifty50 down 0.38%, primarily due to heavy selling in IT, realty, pharmaceutical, and auto sectors.

          <strong>Precious Metals Volatility:</strong> The global precious metals market experienced significant volatility on December 29, 2025, following robust annual gains. Gold fluctuated after falling below the $4,500 per ounce level, and silver also saw a slip.

          <strong>Southeast Asia Investment:</strong> Global capital inflows into Southeast Asia's emerging stock markets reached $337 million in December, marking the most substantial influx since September 2024.

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>
          <strong>Record Performance in 2025:</strong> Tel Aviv stock indexes defied regional conflicts, achieving multiple record highs in 2025 and outperforming global markets. As of December 19, 2025, the TA-35 index soared by 53%, the TA-125 jumped 52%, and the TA-90 rose by 46%. This strong performance was boosted by optimism regarding the removal of the Iranian threat and a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Surge in Foreign Investment:</strong> Foreign investors infused NIS 4.3 billion (approximately $2.3 billion) into Israeli local shares during 2025, primarily targeting the financial and defense sectors, reversing a sell-off from the previous year. The Insurance Index notably soared 165%, and the Banks5 Index jumped 71%, demonstrating the success of financial sector investments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Renewable Energy Boom:</strong> Israeli renewable energy stocks have seen a significant uplift, with companies like Doral, OPC, Enlight, and Tralight experiencing year-to-date gains exceeding 100%. This surge is partly attributed to increased demand for electricity for AI data centers, leading to a shift in policy perception, and a favorable drop in interest rates. Enlight Renewable Energy, for instance, jumped 162% in 2025.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Recent Declines:</strong> On December 25, leading indices on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange faced significant declines, with the TA-35 down 1.8%, TA-125 by 2%, and TA-Banks by 2.2%. This downturn was primarily linked to a downward correction in insurance company stocks and concerns following Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's threat to double taxes on bank profits.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Slowdown in Tech/Startup Funding:</strong> The Israeli technology and startup ecosystem showed signs of stagnation in 2025, with a noticeable slowdown in deal activity and capital raising. Total funding remained around $6 billion, and M&A activity saw fewer domestic deals, shifting towards Israeli companies acquiring foreign firms.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Sapiens International (SAPI) Acquisition:</strong> Sapiens International Corporation's common stock ceased trading on NASDAQ and the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange on December 17, 2025, following its acquisition by global private equity firm Advent.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>QA and Testing Sector Investment:</strong> Israeli startups specializing in Quality Assurance (QA) and software testing, such as Terra Security and MetalBear, attracted significant capital inflows in 2025, highlighting growing investor interest in AI-driven testing solutions.
