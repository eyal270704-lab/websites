                    <strong>Wall Street's "Rotation Trade" Gains Pace:</strong> Investors are shifting away from high-flying artificial intelligence (AI) linked technology stocks and moving into value stocks and other sectors following a Federal Reserve interest rate cut earlier this week. This rotation is viewed by some as a positive sign, indicating increased confidence in the economy and a potential "Goldilocks" scenario of solid growth with subdued inflation.

                        <li>AI-linked stocks faced pressure, with Broadcom tumbling 11.4% despite reporting strong profits, possibly due to concerns about financial forecasts.</li>
                        <li>Nvidia shares fell 3.3%, and Oracle dropped 4.5% after an earlier 11% loss due to disappointing revenue reports.</li>

                    <strong>Market Trends:</strong> The "rotation trade" from growth to value stocks is expected to continue, with investors seeking bargains as recession fears subside and economic resilience grows. The 10-year Treasury yield climbed to 4.18%, which could discourage investors from high stock valuations.

                    <strong>Nasdaq Listing Fees:</strong> Nasdaq is proposing to increase entry fees for companies on its Global and Global Select Markets, aiming to better align fees with the value of a listing and cover rising operational and regulatory oversight costs.

                    <strong>Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE):</strong> As of December 11, 2025, the TA-35 index gained 0.75%, showing overall positive movement. The TASE indices continue to climb despite weak economic forecasts for Israel, with the shekel steadily strengthening and high demand for Israeli debt.

                <li>
                    <strong>Economic Resilience:</strong> Experts maintain a high degree of optimism regarding the Israeli economy, noting the market's ability to correct sharply and then rebound despite security events and credit rating downgrades. There is strong demand for Israeli debt both domestically and overseas.

                <li>
                    <strong>Geopolitical Developments:</strong> Israel issued an evacuation warning for a village in southern Lebanon ahead of a planned strike against Hezbollah infrastructure. While this is a significant security event, no immediate direct impact on Israeli capital markets for December 13, 2025, was detailed in the provided search results beyond the general resilience noted in previous security events.
