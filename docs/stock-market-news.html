      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">U.S. stock markets mostly retrenched on Friday, January 16, concluding a week marked by geopolitical developments. The S&P 500 Index closed down 0.06% at 6,940.01 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.17% to 49,359.33 points, and the Nasdaq Composite Index declined 0.06% to 23,515.39 points.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">European bourses also saw declines on Friday, with the DAX Index closing down 0.22% at 25,297.13 points, the FTSE 100 Index down 0.04% at 10,235.29 points, and the Paris CAC 40 down 0.65% at 8,258.94 points.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Wall Street stocks ended nearly flat on Friday ahead of a long weekend for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, with all three major indexes posting weekly losses as the fourth-quarter earnings season commenced.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Concerns regarding the Federal Reserve's divided stance on monetary policy are seen as a significant risk factor for the stock market in 2026. Stubbornly high inflation, particularly in shelter, has prompted the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to slow its rate-easing cycle, creating friction with President Trump.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">The S&P 500's cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratio recently hit 39.8, a level last observed just before the dot-com crash in 2000, signaling potential overvaluation. Historically, such high CAPE ratios have preceded significant market drops.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">In commodity trading, oil prices rebounded after a 5% drop on Thursday, as President Trump appeared to ease military action against Iran.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Analysts anticipate an 8.2% earnings growth for S&P 500 companies in the fourth quarter compared to the previous year, with upcoming earnings from Netflix, United Airlines, and Procter & Gamble on the agenda for next week.</p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Tel Aviv stocks generally slid on Thursday (likely January 16, 2026), driven by investor anxiety over US President Donald Trump's new tariff policy and intensified military actions in Gaza, coupled with internal political unrest. The TA-125 benchmark index plummeted 3.8%, and the TA-35 index dropped 3.6%.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) confirmed that President Trump's tariff plan, published Wednesday evening, led to declines across global markets, including Israel, on Thursday.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">The TA-125 index reached an all-time high of 4014.31 in January 2026, and on January 16, 2026, it rose to 4002 points, gaining 0.33% from the previous session.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange officially began its transition in January 2026 to align its trading days with global standards, shifting from a Sunday-Thursday week to Monday-Friday. This move aims to attract foreign investors, improve market accessibility, increase liquidity, and facilitate the inclusion of Israeli stocks in leading international indices.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<p class="text-gray-200 my-3 leading-relaxed">Individual investors hold the largest share (58%) of Bezeq The Israel Telecommunication Corp. Ltd. (TLV:BEZQ), with institutions accounting for 42% of ownership.</p>
