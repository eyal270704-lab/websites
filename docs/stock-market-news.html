        <li>U.S. major stock indexes (Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq) concluded January 23rd with mixed results, marking a second consecutive losing week, though all three remain in positive territory for 2026.</li>
        <li>Safe-haven assets saw significant gains, with gold futures reaching new all-time highs near $5,000 an ounce and silver futures surpassing $100 an ounce for the first time on January 23rd. Silver has dramatically outperformed, gaining approximately 34.47% in January and nearly 220% over the past year.</li>
        <li>Geopolitical tensions regarding Greenland tariffs eased as U.S. President Donald Trump retracted threats against European nations after reaching a deal framework with NATO, leading to a partial recovery in the U.S. stock market and dollar index.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement two to three rate cuts in 2026, with a projected 8-10% decline in the Dollar Index, although no cuts are expected at the late January meeting. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, showed a monthly increase of 0.2% and a year-over-year rise of 2.8%.</li>
        <li>AI-linked capital spending, particularly in data centers, significantly supported U.S. equities and GDP growth in 2025, despite concerns about investment concentration and rising costs for power and semiconductors.</li>
        <li>Intel (INTC) shares dropped 17% on January 23rd following a subdued outlook, while "Magnificent Seven" tech giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia showed gains.</li>
        <li>The Czechoslovak Group (CSG), a Czech industrial and defense holding, experienced a highly successful IPO on Euronext Amsterdam on January 23rd, with shares soaring 31.4%, making it the Czech Republic's most valuable company.</li>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>The Israeli shekel continues to demonstrate exceptional strength, trading at one of its highest levels since the mid-1990s, strengthening 1.6% against the dollar in the first two weeks of 2026 despite regional tensions. This strength is driven by substantial foreign investment in local tech companies and the stock market.</li>
        <li>The robust performance of the shekel contributed to a decrease in Israel's annual inflation rate to 2.6% in 2025, falling within the government's target range of 1-3%.</li>
        <li>On January 21st, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) saw a slight downturn, with the TA 35 index losing 0.41%. Notable individual stock performances included Tower Semiconductor Ltd (TASE:TSEM) rising 5.23% to a 5-year high.</li>
        <li>Merger and acquisition deals involving Israeli-founded tech companies reached a record NIS 82.3 billion ($26.24 billion) in 2025, a fivefold increase from the previous year, highlighted by Google's $32 billion acquisition of Wiz.</li>
        <li>Starting January 2026, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange will align with international standards by shifting its trading days to Monday through Friday, a move aimed at attracting foreign investors and enhancing market liquidity.</li>
        <li>The Israeli government is planning to sell 25-30% stakes in state-owned defense companies, Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael, on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</li>
        <li>Bank Leumi (TASE:LUMI) has experienced a 3.3% decline over the past 7 days but boasts a 3.6% year-to-date return and an impressive 74.6% return over the last year.</li>
