      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Global Market Highlights</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
        <li>Global market sentiment is characterized by cautious optimism amidst mixed economic signals and ongoing geopolitical uncertainties.</li>
        <li>In the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded higher, while the S&P 500 remained flat and the Nasdaq composite fell, primarily due to losses in major tech stocks like Nvidia, Apple, and Oracle.</li>
        <li>U.S. defense stocks, including L3Harris Technologies, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and AeroVironment, saw significant gains, fueled by President Trump's proposed increase in military spending and heightened geopolitical tensions.</li>
        <li>Asian markets presented a mixed picture, with Indian indices (Nifty 50 and Sensex) opening lower due to foreign investor outflows and geopolitical concerns, while other Asian shares generally rose, and Chinese AI startup MiniMax surged 78% on its Hong Kong debut.</li>
        <li>The bond market experienced record volumes, particularly in euro issuance, signaling strong activity in public sector, covered bonds, and investment-grade corporate markets.</li>
        <li>The Euro strengthened against the U.S. Dollar following robust Eurozone manufacturing data, while the British Pound faced pressure amid concerns over the UK's economic outlook. The Indian Rupee weakened against the dollar and euro due to significant foreign institutional investor (FII) selling.</li>
        <li>Gold prices saw a slight increase, with futures trading up 0.4%. Crude oil and Brent oil also experienced rises.</li>
        <li>Traders are closely monitoring the upcoming U.S. Labor Department's monthly job report for December and an anticipated Supreme Court decision regarding President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs.</li>
        <li>Notable tech stocks Adobe (ADBE) and Salesforce (CRM) are highlighted as potential rebound candidates for 2026, demonstrating strong quarterly results and leveraging AI integration.</li>
        <li>India's MTAR Technologies Ltd. surged 8.31%, hitting a new 52-week high and outperforming its sector and the broader Sensex.</li>
        <li>Global private markets have expanded substantially to approximately $16 trillion, raising concerns about their interconnectedness with traditional financial institutions and potential implications for financial stability in the UK.</li>
        <li>China is increasingly becoming a prime destination for long-term foreign capital, with global capital flows reorienting towards emerging markets, particularly in high-tech, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, and new energy sectors.</li>
        <li>The U.S. Treasury market is undergoing significant structural changes, including mandatory treasury clearing by the end of 2026 and the launch of a new CME-FICC cross margining program in Q1 2026 to facilitate margin offsets.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Capital Market Highlights</h2>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
        <li>Today, January 9, 2026, marks the historic first Friday trading session for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE), as it officially transitions to a Monday-Friday trading week, aligning with global market standards. This strategic shift aims to attract foreign investors, enhance market accessibility, boost liquidity, and facilitate the inclusion of Israeli stocks in leading international indices.</li>
        <li>On Thursday, January 8, the TA 35 index closed 0.40% lower, with more stocks declining than rising. Top performers included Next Vision Stabilized Systems, Elbit Systems Ltd, and Azrieli Group Ltd, while Tower Semiconductor Ltd, Camtek Ltd, and Nova were among the biggest losers.</li>
        <li>Israeli stocks are considered attractive at the start of 2026, with the Bank of Israel forecasting a 5.2% GDP growth for the year, contingent on sustained geopolitical calm in the region.</li>
        <li>Geopolitical developments remain a significant factor, with U.S. President Donald Trump expected to announce his "Board of Peace" to oversee the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Unfortunately, Israeli strikes across Gaza reportedly killed at least 13 people on Thursday.</li>
