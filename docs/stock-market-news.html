      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>US stock markets saw a rebound on Thursday, January 15th, with the S&P 500 rising 0.26% to 6,944.47, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gaining 0.60% to 49,442.44, and the Nasdaq Composite advancing 0.25% to 23,530.02.</li>
        <li>Semiconductor stocks, including Nvidia, AMD, and ASML Holding, led the market higher, fueled by strong earnings and ambitious capital spending plans from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), boosting optimism around AI demand.</li>
        <li>The banking sector also performed well, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley reporting better-than-expected profits driven by robust dealmaking and growth in wealth management. BlackRock achieved record assets under management.</li>
        <li>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline, with Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate futures falling over 4%, which helped to ease broader inflation concerns.</li>
        <li>Economic data from the US indicated resilient labor conditions, as initial jobless claims dropped to a two-year low, and New York state manufacturing activity showed a rebound.</li>
        <li>In Asia on Friday, January 16th, markets presented a mixed picture; while the Shanghai Composite and Shenzhen Component opened higher, the Hang Seng Index declined 0.3% following a five-day winning streak, partly due to increased margin requirements by Chinese regulators. South Korea's Kospi continued its trend of record highs, and Taiwan's Taiex also saw gains.</li>
        <li>European markets on Thursday, January 15th, generally trended upward, with Germany's DAX 40 rising 0.3% and the FTSE 100 also closing higher, though the Paris CAC 40 registered a slight decrease.</li>
        <li>The European bond market witnessed strong demand for financial institution (FIG) bonds, characterized by new issue premiums close to zero, signaling intense investor competition for allocations.</li>
        <li>A significant US-Taiwan trade agreement was signed, aiming to boost US semiconductor production and reduce tariffs on Taiwanese goods, with TSMC planning to establish factories in Arizona.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-3 text-black">
        <li>The Bank of Israel projects a robust GDP growth of 5.2% for 2026, contingent on the continuation of relative geopolitical calm. Inflation is anticipated to stabilize firmly within the 2% target range.</li>
        <li>In a surprise move on January 5th, the Bank of Israel lowered its interest rate by 0.25% to 4%, a decision that signaled confidence in inflation stability and subsequently led to a surge in the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange.</li>
        <li>Israeli stocks have demonstrated strong performance, outperforming the S&P 500 over the past year. The VanEck Israel ETF (ISRA) is considered appealing, supported by a 6.05% trailing earnings yield and favorable GDP growth forecasts.</li>
        <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange commenced 2026 with considerable momentum, building on a 51% surge from 2025, driven by strong high-tech sector performance and record defense exports.</li>
        <li>The Israeli Shekel has shown appreciation against both the US Dollar and the Euro since the Bank of Israel's recent interest rate decision.</li>
