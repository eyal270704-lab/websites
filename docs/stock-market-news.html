          <strong>Market Closures:</strong> Many major global markets, including those in Australia, Hong Kong, most of Europe (e.g., London Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, Frankfurt's DAX), and Canada, are closed today for the Boxing Day holiday.
        </li>
        <li class="text-black leading-relaxed">
          <strong>US Market Activity:</strong> The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq are open for normal trading hours, however, trading volumes are anticipated to be light due to the holiday period. U.S. stock futures edged lower early Friday, and markets opened largely flat in light post-Christmas trading.
        </li>
        <li class="text-black leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Asian Market Performance:</strong> Asian stocks generally rose to a six-week high. Japan's Topix climbed to a record high, gaining 0.5%, and South Korea's benchmark index increased by 0.6%, making it the year's best-performing major stock market with a 72% annual gain. China's blue-chip stock index saw a 0.27% rise, on track for an 18% annual gain.
        </li>
        <li class="text-black leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Precious Metals Rally:</strong> Gold and silver continued their impressive rally, surging to new record highs. Spot silver jumped over 4%, and gold hit a record peak, trading around $4,503.39 to $4,541.80 per ounce. This rally is attributed to factors such as central bank purchases, strong inflows into gold-backed ETFs, and investor concerns regarding currency debasement and rising global debt. Gold has soared over 71% and silver is up 158% this year.

        <li class="text-black leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Notable Stock News:</strong> Nike (NKE) shares rose over 4% on Wednesday following the disclosure of a personal stock purchase by Apple CEO Tim Cook.

        <li class="text-black leading-relaxed">
          <strong>Market Trends:</strong> Investor attention is currently focused on potential interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2026. While a "Santa Claus rally" period is noted, thin holiday trading volumes might suggest a lack of strong conviction. Market volatility is expected to persist into the next year, with growing concerns about a K-shaped economic recovery.
