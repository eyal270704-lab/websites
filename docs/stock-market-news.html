          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
            <li>U.S. stock markets (NYSE and Nasdaq) are open for normal trading on Friday, December 26, 2025, despite it being a federal holiday. Markets were closed on Christmas Day (December 25) and had an early close on Christmas Eve (December 24).</li>
            <li>On Wednesday, December 24, major U.S. stock indices closed higher for the fifth consecutive day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite, and S&P 500 all reaching new record highs. This rally was largely driven by artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.</li>
            <li>U.S. stock futures showed a slight downward trend early Friday morning after the Christmas break, with trading volumes anticipated to be light.</li>
            <li>The U.S. economy saw stronger-than-expected third-quarter GDP growth, reported at 4.3%.</li>
            <li>Expectations for near-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve have eased, though market participants still foresee two rate cuts by the end of 2026. The Fed's benchmark lending rate stands in the range of 3.50-3.75% after a 75-basis-point reduction in 2025.</li>
            <li>Notable stock performances on Wednesday included Micron Technology (up 3.8%), Nike (up 4.6% following Apple CEO Tim Cook's disclosed personal stock purchase), and Citigroup (up 1.8%).</li>
            <li>Snowflake (SNOW) is reportedly in advanced discussions to acquire Observe, an AI-native observability startup, in a deal valued around $1 billion.</li>
            <li>Prudential Financial (PRU) shares rebounded after six sessions of declines, bolstered by stabilizing market sentiment and a planned $1 billion share buyback program commencing in 2026.</li>
            <li>The S&P 500 index is reportedly eyeing the 7,000 mark.</li>
            <li>Gold prices continued their ascent, hitting record highs, influenced by expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts and ongoing geopolitical tensions.</li>
            <li>Several European markets, as well as Australia and Hong Kong, were closed today for the Boxing Day holiday. Other Asia-Pacific markets, including those in Japan, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, registered gains.</li>
