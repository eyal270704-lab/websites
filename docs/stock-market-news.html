          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">US Stock Markets Rally Continues:</strong> Major US equity indexes, including the Dow, Nasdaq, and S&P 500, extended their gains, building on a strong rebound from Wednesday. This positive movement was largely attributed to easing geopolitical tensions over Greenland and President Trump's decision to retract threats of new tariffs on European allies.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Inflation Data Meets Expectations:</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index data for October and November showed a 0.2% month-over-month increase and a 2.8% year-over-year rise (excluding food and fuel for November), aligning with economists' expectations but remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Treasury Yields and Commodities:</strong> The 10-year Treasury yield remained relatively stable at approximately 4.27%. Crude oil prices dipped below $60 per barrel as geopolitical concerns subsided. Conversely, safe-haven gold futures advanced to around $4,870 an ounce, after hitting a new all-time high of nearly $4,900 on Wednesday. Bitcoin was observed trading around $89,100.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Natural Gas Surges:</strong> Natural gas prices experienced a significant surge, driven by forecasts of an impending severe Arctic cold wave across much of the Midwestern and Eastern United States, increasing demand expectations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Notable Corporate Earnings:</strong>

              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">GE Aerospace (GE)</strong> reported strong quarterly results, surpassing analyst estimates, and provided an optimistic outlook for 2026.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Procter & Gamble (PG)</strong> shares declined after the consumer products giant missed sales estimates in its latest quarterly report.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Abbott Laboratories (ABT)</strong> and <strong class="font-semibold text-white">McCormick (MKC)</strong> also saw their stocks fall following their quarterly earnings announcements.</li>
              <li><strong class="font-semibold text-white">Intel (INTC)</strong> shares were slightly down in pre-market trading, ahead of its fourth-quarter results, after experiencing a nearly 12% surge on Wednesday.</li>

          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Bank Hapoalim's Landmark Bond Issuance:</strong> Bank Hapoalim, one of Israel's largest banks, successfully executed a US$2 billion bond issuance. This represents the largest foreign bond issuance by an Israeli bank to date, attracting approximately US$7 billion in demand from institutional investors.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Homeland Security Sector Expansion:</strong> KeepZone AI Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Jeffs' Brands Ltd. (Nasdaq: JFBR), announced a non-exclusive distribution agreement with STI Ltd., an Israeli developer of specialized homeland security technologies. This agreement covers the distribution of STI's products in Canada and Mexico.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Attractive Savings Rates Amidst Rate Cut Expectations:</strong> Economists anticipate that the Bank of Israel's interest rate will likely decrease to 3.25%-3.5% by the end of 2026. This outlook makes current savings account rates in Israel particularly appealing for locking in higher returns.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong class="font-semibold text-white">Strong Israeli Market Performance:</strong> Israeli stocks have demonstrated notable outperformance compared to the S&P 500 over the past year. This is attributed to a ceasefire in Gaza and favorable valuations. The Bank of Israel projects a robust 5.2% GDP growth for 2026, significantly surpassing the expected growth rate in the United States.
