        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Global Market Highlights</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
          <li>Global stocks showed mixed reactions, with Asian markets generally rallying due to optimism over Artificial Intelligence (AI) investments, while European markets saw modest gains.</li>
          <li>In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 surged over 3.3%, South Korea's Kospi climbed 3.1% to 3.4% reaching a record high, and Taiwan's benchmark gained approximately 2.9%. MSCI's Asia-Pacific index (excluding Japan) also reached record highs.</li>
          <li>Early European trading saw Germany's DAX up 0.8%, the CAC 40 in Paris gaining 0.3%, and Britain's FTSE 100 inching up 0.2%.</li>
          <li>U.S. stock futures indicated a higher opening, with S&P 500 contracts up around 0.25% and Nasdaq-100 futures ahead roughly 0.55%, balancing cooler manufacturing data with hopes for interest rate cuts.</li>
          <li>The U.S. Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to implement at least one, and potentially two, more interest rate cuts in 2026, driven by an elevated unemployment rate despite persistent inflation.</li>
          <li>Geopolitical developments, specifically the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, had a calm market reaction, with analysts suggesting minor near-term economic implications. However, oil prices fell back, while precious metals saw a surge.</li>
          <li>Notable U.S. stock movements included surges in SanDisk (SNDK) by 15.95%, Baidu (BIDU) by 15.03%, and AST SpaceMobile (ASTS) by 14.92%. Conversely, Microsoft and Tesla experienced declines of 2.2% and 2.6% respectively, after Tesla reported a second consecutive year of falling sales.</li>
          <li>The week's economic calendar includes keenly watched U.S. labor market data, such as the non-farm payrolls report and unemployment rate, along with the onset of the Q3 corporate earnings season.</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="mb-8">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Israeli Capital Market Highlights</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
          <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) has officially shifted its trading week to Monday through Friday, effective January 05, 2026. This change aligns the Israeli capital market with international standards, with Friday trading concluding at 1:50 PM or 2:00 PM local time.</li>
          <li>This strategic move is intended to enhance the international appeal of the Israeli market, attract foreign investments, improve accessibility, increase liquidity, and facilitate the inclusion of Israeli stocks in major global indices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Indian Capital Market Highlights</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 text-black space-y-2">
          <li>Indian equity markets closed lower in volatile trading, with the Nifty 50 down 0.3% at 26,250.30 and the BSE Sensex declining 0.38% to 85,439.62, primarily pulled down by the IT and oil & gas sectors. The Nifty briefly touched a record high earlier in the day before retreating.</li>
          <li>Sectoral performance was mixed; Information Technology (IT) stocks, including Infosys and HCL Technologies, faced selling pressure, with declines over 3%. In contrast, banking stocks showed resilience, while the Realty and Consumer Durables indices emerged as top gainers. The Nifty Metal index recorded a strong jump of 5.7%.</li>
          <li>Notable individual stocks included Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL), which rose by almost 3%, and Tata Steel, gaining nearly 2%. However, ITC saw a significant drop of 13.39% following a substantial increase in cigarette excise duties.</li>
