          <li class="text-black">The US Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is a major focus this week, with market participants anticipating another rate cut on Wednesday to a range of 3.5%-3.75%.</li>
          <li class="text-black">Remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell following the decision will be closely scrutinized for insights into the central bank's plans for 2026.</li>
          <li class="text-black">US stock indexes saw modest gains last week, with the Nasdaq leading the uptrend. The S&P 500 recorded a 0.3% gain, indicating some diminishing momentum after a strong previous surge.</li>

          <li class="text-black">Key corporate earnings reports are expected this week from companies including Oracle, Broadcom, GameStop, Costco, Adobe, and AutoZone. Oracle's stock faced a significant drop in November due to concerns regarding its debt financing for AI infrastructure, while Broadcom's share price has benefited from optimism surrounding its collaboration with Google-parent Alphabet.</li>
          <li class="text-black">Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has expressed concerns over growing fiscal deficits in the United States, which have been on an upward trend since 2002, rather than focusing on a potential AI bubble.</li>
          <li class="text-black">Foreign investors withdrew ₹11,820 crore from Indian equities in the first week of December, attributed to a depreciating rupee and global year-end portfolio adjustments. However, domestic institutional investors countered this outflow by purchasing ₹19,783 crore in equities during the same period.</li>
          <li class="text-black">The FTSE 100, London's blue-chip index, closed the week lower, slipping almost 0.5% to 9,667 points, impacted by weakness in sectors such as engineering and energy.</li>
