          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
            <li>The S&P 500 rebounded 3.7% last week, erasing prior losses and nearing a new all-time high, driven by strong investor sentiment. Small-cap and high-beta stocks, along with blockchain companies and precious metals, notably outperformed.</li>
            <li>Nvidia (NVDA) was the only major tech stock among the "Mag 7" to experience losses, raising questions about the sustained momentum in AI-driven gains.</li>
            <li>Commodity markets saw gold prices rise to a two-week high, poised for a fourth consecutive monthly gain, while oil trended downwards. Copper surged by 2.5%, reaching a new peak of $11,210.50 per tonne, bolstered by tightening supply and robust global demand.</li>
            <li>Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) withdrew ₹3,765 crore from Indian equities in November, influenced by global risk-off sentiment, volatility in tech stocks, and a preference for primary markets over secondary ones. However, major Wall Street firms anticipate a rebound in Indian markets next year.</li>
            <li>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is considering a potential 25 basis point cut in its benchmark lending rate due to subdued inflationary pressures, although some experts suggest a pause is more likely given stronger-than-expected Q2 GDP growth of 8.2%.</li>
            <li>The global economy is currently navigating a period described as "limping" into November 2025, facing challenges from geopolitical tensions, policy fragmentation, and structural shifts.</li>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-black">
            <li>The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) indices recorded significant gains, with the TA-35 rising 1.2%, the TA-125 gaining 1.3%, the TA-90 adding 1.7%, and the TA-Banks index climbing 1.4%. The TA-125 index reached 3,482.25 points.</li>
            <li>This market rally followed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's submission of a 111-page pardon request to President Isaac Herzog, which immediately drew market attention regarding government stability.</li>
            <li>Political uncertainty resulting from the pardon request could complicate major economic decisions, including the state budget, potentially leading investors to demand a higher local risk premium. The Bank of Israel has consistently highlighted elevated macro risks linked to such uncertainty.</li>
            <li>Among notable stocks, Bank Leumi rose 1.31%, Bank Hapoalim climbed 2.26% to an all-time high, and Teva advanced 1.91% reaching a seven-year peak. Clal Insurance Enterprises Holdings Ltd also saw a 3.03% increase.</li>
            <li>Conversely, Shufersal fell 2.44%, continuing its recent slide, while Palram dropped 9.1% and Tamar Petroleum decreased by 5.39%.</li>
            <li>Cellcom Israel announced a dividend distribution.</li>
            <li>Key economic indicators for Israel include an interest rate of 4.25% (November 2025), an inflation rate of 2.5% (October 2025), and an unemployment rate of 3.0% (October 2025).</li>
